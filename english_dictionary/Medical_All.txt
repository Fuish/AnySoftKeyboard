   The  history of science is the study of the development of science and
   scientific  knowledge,  including both the natural sciences and social
   sciences.  (The  history  of  the arts and humanities is termed as the
   history  of scholarship.) Science is a body of empirical, theoretical,
   and   practical   knowledge  about  the  natural  world,  produced  by
   scientists  who emphasize the observation, explanation, and prediction
   of real world phenomena. Historiography of science, in contrast, often
   draws  on  the  historical  methods  of  both intellectual history and
   social history.

   The  English  word  scientist  is  relatively  recent—first  coined by
   William  Whewell in the 19th century. Previously, people investigating
   nature   called   themselves  natural  philosophers.  While  empirical
   investigations   of  the  natural  world  have  been  described  since
   classical  antiquity  (for example, by Thales, Aristotle, and others),
   and  scientific  methods have been employed since the Middle Ages (for
   example,  by  Ibn  al-Haytham,  and  Roger  Bacon), the dawn of modern
   science  is  often  traced  back  to  the  early  modern period and in
   particular  to  the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and
   17th-century  Europe.  Scientific  methods  are  considered  to  be so
   fundamental  to  modern  science  that some consider earlier inquiries
   into  nature  to  be  pre-scientific.^[1] Traditionally, historians of
   science  have  defined  science  sufficiently broadly to include those
   inquiries.^[2]

   From  the  18th  century  through  late  20th  century, the history of
   science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often
   presented  in  a progressive narrative in which true theories replaced
   false  beliefs.^[3]  More  recent  historical interpretations, such as
   those  of  Thomas  Kuhn,  tend  to  portray  the history of science in
   different  terms,  such  as  that of competing paradigms or conceptual
   systems  in  a  wider  matrix  that  includes  intellectual, cultural,
   economic and political themes outside of science.^[4]

Early cultures[edit]

   Main article: History of science in early cultures
   See also: Protoscience and Alchemy

   In  prehistoric times, advice and knowledge was passed from generation
   to  generation in an oral tradition. For example, the domestication of
   maize  for  agriculture  has  been  dated  to about 9,000 years ago in
   southern     Mexico,     before    the    development    of    writing
   systems.^[5]^[6]^[7]  Similarly, archaeological evidence indicates the
   development     of     astronomical     knowledge    in    preliterate
   societies.^[8]^[9]

   The  development  of  writing  enabled  knowledge  to  be  stored  and
   communicated  across  generations with much greater fidelity. Combined
   with  the  development  of agriculture, which allowed for a surplus of
   food,  it  became possible for early civilizations to develop, because
   more  time  and  effort  could  be  devoted  to tasks (other than food
   production)  than  hunter-gatherers  or  early subsistence farmers had
   available. This surplus allowed a community to support individuals who
   did  things  other  than work towards bare survival. These other tasks
   included  systematic  studies  of nature, study of written information
   gathered  and  recorded by others, and often of adding to that body of
   information.

   Many  ancient  civilizations  collected  astronomical information in a
   systematic  manner  through  simple  observation.  Though  they had no
   knowledge  of  the  real  physical structure of the planets and stars,
   many  theoretical  explanations were proposed. Basic facts about human
   physiology  were  known  in  some places, and alchemy was practiced in
   several    civilizations.^[10]^[11]    Considerable   observation   of
   macroscopic flora and fauna was also performed.

Africa[edit]

   Ancient  Egypt made significant advances in astronomy, mathematics and
   medicine.^[12] Their development of geometry was a necessary outgrowth
   of  surveying  to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which
   was  flooded  annually by the Nile river. The 3-4-5 right triangle and
   other  rules  of  thumb were used to build rectilinear structures, and
   the  post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt was also a center of
   alchemy research for much of the Mediterranean.The Edwin Smith papyrus
   is  one  of  the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the
   earliest  document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it
   might  be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience. However,
   while  Egyptian  medicine  had  some  effective  practices, it was not
   without  its  ineffective  and  sometimes  harmful  practices. Medical
   historians  believe  that  ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example,
   was  largely  ineffective.^[13] Nevertheless, it applies the following
   components  to  the  treatment  of  disease:  examination,  diagnosis,
   treatment,  and  prognosis,^[2]  which display strong parallels to the
   basic empirical method of science and according to G. E. R. Lloyd^[14]
   played  a significant role in the development of this methodology. The
   Ebers  papyrus  (c.  1550  BC)  also  contains evidence of traditional
   empiricism.

Ancient Near East[edit]

   Further  information:  Babylonian  astronomy,  Babylonian mathematics,
   Babylonian  medicine,  Egyptian  astronomy,  Egyptian  mathematics and
   Egyptian medicine
   Mesopotamian  clay  tablet,  492  BC. Writing allowed the recording of
   astronomical information.

   From  their  beginnings  in  Sumer  (now  Iraq)  around  3500  BC, the
   Mesopotamian  people  began  to attempt to record some observations of
   the world with numerical data. But their observations and measurements
   were   seemingly   taken  for  purposes  other  than  for  elucidating
   scientific  laws. A concrete instance of Pythagoras' law was recorded,
   as  early  as  the  18th century BC: the Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet
   Plimpton   322  records  a  number  of  Pythagorean  triplets  (3,4,5)
   (5,12,13).  ...,  dated 1900 BC, possibly millennia before Pythagoras,
   [3]  but  an  abstract  formulation  of  the  Pythagorean  theorem was
   not.^[15]

   In Babylonian astronomy, records of the motions of the stars, planets,
   and the moon are left on thousands of clay tablets created by scribes.
   Even   today,   astronomical   periods   identified   by  Mesopotamian
   proto-scientists  are  still  widely used in Western calendars such as
   the  solar  year  and the lunar month. Using these data they developed
   arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the
   course  of  the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances
   of  the  Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few
   astronomers'  names  are  known,  such  as that of Kidinnu, a Chaldean
   astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in
   use  for  today's  calendars.  Babylonian astronomy was "the first and
   highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description
   of  astronomical phenomena." According to the historian A. Aaboe, "all
   subsequent  varieties  of  scientific  astronomy,  in  the Hellenistic
   world,  in  India,  in  Islam,  and  in  the  West—if  not  indeed all
   subsequent  endeavour  in  the  exact  sciences—depend upon Babylonian
   astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways."^[16]

Greco-Roman world[edit]

   Main article: History of science in classical antiquity
   The School of Athens by Raphael.

   In  Classical Antiquity, the inquiry into the workings of the universe
   took  place  both  in  investigations aimed at such practical goals as
   establishing  a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety
   of  illnesses  and  in  those abstract investigations known as natural
   philosophy. The ancient people who are considered the first scientists
   may   have   thought   of   themselves  as  natural  philosophers,  as
   practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as
   followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).

   The  earliest  Greek  philosophers,  known  as the pre-Socratics,^[17]
   provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their
   neighbors:  "How  did  the  ordered  cosmos  in  which we live come to
   be?"^[18] The pre-Socratic philosopher Thales (640-546 BC), dubbed the
   "father  of  science",  was  the  first  to postulate non-supernatural
   explanations  for  natural phenomena, for example, that land floats on
   water  and  that  earthquakes are caused by the agitation of the water
   upon which the land floats, rather than the god Poseidon.^[19] Thales'
   student  Pythagoras  of  Samos  founded  the Pythagorean school, which
   investigated  mathematics  for  its  own  sake,  and  was the first to
   postulate  that  the  Earth is spherical in shape.^[20] Leucippus (5th
   century  BC) introduced atomism, the theory that all matter is made of
   indivisible,   imperishable  units  called  atoms.  This  was  greatly
   expanded by his pupil Democritus.

   Subsequently,  Plato  and  Aristotle  produced  the  first  systematic
   discussions  of  natural  philosophy,  which  did  much to shape later
   investigations of nature. Their development of deductive reasoning was
   of  particular  importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry.
   Plato  founded  the  Platonic  Academy in 387 BC, whose motto was "Let
   none  unversed  in  geometry  enter here", and turned out many notable
   philosophers.  Plato's student Aristotle introduced empiricism and the
   notion  that  universal  truths  can be arrived at via observation and
   induction,   thereby   laying   the   foundations  of  the  scientific
   method.^[21]  Aristotle  also  produced  many biological writings that
   were  empirical  in  nature,  focusing on biological causation and the
   diversity   of   life.  He  made  countless  observations  of  nature,
   especially  the  habits  and  attributes  of plants and animals in the
   world  around  him,  classified  more  than  540  animal  species, and
   dissected  at  least  50.  Aristotle's  writings profoundly influenced
   subsequent   Islamic   and  European  scholarship,  though  they  were
   eventually superseded in the Scientific Revolution.
   Archimedes  used  the method of exhaustion to approximate the value of
   p.

   The  important  legacy of this period included substantial advances in
   factual knowledge, especially in anatomy, zoology, botany, mineralogy,
   geography,  mathematics  and astronomy; an awareness of the importance
   of  certain  scientific  problems,  especially  those  related  to the
   problem   of   change  and  its  causes;  and  a  recognition  of  the
   methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena
   and  of  undertaking  empirical  research.^[22] In the Hellenistic age
   scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek
   thought:  the  application  of  mathematics  and  deliberate empirical
   research,   in   their  scientific  investigations.^[23]  Thus,  clear
   unbroken  lines  of  influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic
   philosophers,  to  medieval Muslim philosophers and scientists, to the
   European Renaissance and Enlightenment, to the secular sciences of the
   modern  day. Neither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks,
   but  the  Socratic  method  did,  along  with the idea of Forms, great
   advances  in  geometry,  logic, and the natural sciences. According to
   Benjamin   Farrington,   former   Professor  of  Classics  at  Swansea
   University:

          "Men  were  weighing  for  thousands of years before Archimedes
          worked  out  the  laws  of  equilibrium;  they  must  have  had
          practical and intuitional knowledge of the principles involved.
          What   Archimedes   did   was   to  sort  out  the  theoretical
          implications  of  this  practical  knowledge  and  present  the
          resulting body of knowledge as a logically coherent system."

   and again:

          "With astonishment we find ourselves on the threshold of modern
          science.  Nor  should  it  be  supposed  that  by some trick of
          translation  the  extracts have been given an air of modernity.
          Far  from  it. The vocabulary of these writings and their style
          are  the  source  from  which our own vocabulary and style have
          been derived."^[24]

   The  astronomer  Aristarchus  of  Samos  was the first known person to
   propose a heliocentric model of the solar system, while the geographer
   Eratosthenes  accurately  calculated  the  circumference of the Earth.
   Hipparchus  (c.  190 –  c.  120 BC) produced the first systematic star
   catalog.  The  level  of  achievement  in  Hellenistic  astronomy  and
   engineering   is  impressively  shown  by  the  Antikythera  mechanism
   (150-100  BC),  an  analog  computer  for  calculating the position of
   planets.   Technological  artifacts  of  similar  complexity  did  not
   reappear  until  the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks
   appeared in Europe.^[25]

   In  medicine,  Hippocrates  (c.  460 BC – c. 370 BC) and his followers
   were  the  first  to describe many diseases and medical conditions and
   developed  the  Hippocratic Oath for physicians, still relevant and in
   use  today.  Herophilos  (335–280  BC)  was  the  first  to  base  his
   conclusions  on  dissection  of  the  human  body  and to describe the
   nervous  system.  Galen  (129 –  c.  200  AD) performed many audacious
   operations—including  brain  and  eye  surgeries—  that were not tried
   again for almost two millennia.
   One  of  the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's Elements, found at
   Oxyrhynchus and dated to c. 100 AD.^[26]

   In   Hellenistic   Egypt,  the  mathematician  Euclid  laid  down  the
   foundations  of  mathematical  rigor  and  introduced  the concepts of
   definition,  axiom,  theorem  and  proof  still  in  use  today in his
   Elements,  considered the most influential textbook ever written.^[27]
   Archimedes,  considered  one  of  the  greatest  mathematicians of all
   time,^[28]  is  credited  with  using  the  method  of  exhaustion  to
   calculate  the  area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of
   an  infinite  series,  and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of
   Pi.^[29]  He  is  also  known in physics for laying the foundations of
   hydrostatics,  statics,  and  the  explanation of the principle of the
   lever.

   Theophrastus  wrote  some  of  the earliest descriptions of plants and
   animals,  establishing  the  first taxonomy and looking at minerals in
   terms  of  their properties such as hardness. Pliny the Elder produced
   what  is  one  of the largest encyclopedias of the natural world in 77
   AD,  and  must  be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus.
   For  example,  he  accurately  describes  the  octahedral shape of the
   diamond,  and  proceeds  to  mention  that  diamond  dust  is  used by
   engravers  to  cut  and polish other gems owing to its great hardness.
   His  recognition  of the importance of crystal shape is a precursor to
   modern  crystallography,  while  mention  of  numerous  other minerals
   presages  mineralogy.  He  also  recognises  that  other minerals have
   characteristic  crystal  shapes,  but  in  one  example,  confuses the
   crystal  habit  with  the work of lapidaries. He was also the first to
   recognise that amber was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he
   had seen samples with trapped insects within them.

India[edit]

   Main article: Science and technology in ancient India
   Ancient  India  was an early leader in metallurgy, as evidenced by the
   wrought-iron Pillar of Delhi.

   Mathematics:  The  earliest  traces  of  mathematical knowledge in the
   Indian  subcontinent appear with the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 4th
   millennium BC ~ c. 3rd millennium BC). The people of this civilization
   made  bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1, considered
   favorable for the stability of a brick structure.^[30] They also tried
   to  standardize  measurement  of  length to a high degree of accuracy.
   They  designed  a  ruler—the  Mohenjo-daro  ruler—whose unit of length
   (approximately  1.32 inches  or  3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten
   equal  parts.  Bricks  manufactured  in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had
   dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length.^[31]

   Indian  astronomer  and  mathematician  Aryabhata  (476-550),  in  his
   Aryabhatiya  (499)  introduced  a  number  of  trigonometric functions
   (including  sine,  versine,  cosine  and  inverse sine), trigonometric
   tables,   and  techniques  and  algorithms  of  algebra.  In  628  AD,
   Brahmagupta    suggested    that    gravity    was    a    force    of
   attraction.^[32]^[33]  He  also  lucidly  explained the use of zero as
   both  a  placeholder  and a decimal digit, along with the Hindu-Arabic
   numeral  system  now  used  universally  throughout  the world. Arabic
   translations  of the two astronomers' texts were soon available in the
   Islamic  world,  introducing  what would become Arabic numerals to the
   Islamic  World  by  the  9th  century.^[34]^[35]  During the 14th–16th
   centuries,  the  Kerala  school  of  astronomy  and  mathematics  made
   significant   advances   in   astronomy  and  especially  mathematics,
   including  fields  such  as  trigonometry and analysis. In particular,
   Madhava  of  Sangamagrama  is  considered the "founder of mathematical
   analysis".^[36]

   Astronomy:  The  first  textual mention of astronomical concepts comes
   from the Vedas, religious literature of India.^[37] According to Sarma
   (2008):  "One  finds in the Rigveda intelligent speculations about the
   genesis  of  the  universe from nonexistence, the configuration of the
   universe,  the  spherical  self-supporting  earth, and the year of 360
   days  divided  into  12  equal parts of 30 days each with a periodical
   intercalary  month.".^[37]  The  first  12  chapters  of the Siddhanta
   Shiromani,  written by Bhaskara in the 12th century, cover topics such
   as:  mean  longitudes  of the planets; true longitudes of the planets;
   the  three  problems  of  diurnal  rotation; syzygies; lunar eclipses;
   solar  eclipses;  latitudes  of the planets; risings and settings; the
   moon's   crescent;  conjunctions  of  the  planets  with  each  other;
   conjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars; and the patas of the
   sun  and  moon. The 13 chapters of the second part cover the nature of
   the  sphere,  as  well  as  significant astronomical and trigonometric
   calculations based on it.

   Nilakantha Somayaji's astronomical treatise the Tantrasangraha similar
   in  nature to the Tychonic system proposed by Tycho Brahe had been the
   most  accurate astronomical model until the time of Johannes Kepler in
   the 17th century.^[38]

   Linguistics:  Some  of the earliest linguistic activities can be found
   in  Iron  Age  India (1st millennium BC) with the analysis of Sanskrit
   for  the purpose of the correct recitation and interpretation of Vedic
   texts.  The most notable grammarian of Sanskrit was Pa?ini (c. 520–460
   BC), whose grammar formulates close to 4,000 rules which together form
   a  compact  generative  grammar  of Sanskrit. Inherent in his analytic
   approach are the concepts of the phoneme, the morpheme and the root.

   Medicine:  Findings  from Neolithic graveyards in what is now Pakistan
   show  evidence of proto-dentistry among an early farming culture.^[39]
   Ayurveda  is  a  system  of  traditional  medicine  that originated in
   ancient  India  before 2500 BC,^[40] and is now practiced as a form of
   alternative medicine in other parts of the world. Its most famous text
   is  the  Susrutasamhita  of  Susruta,  which is notable for describing
   procedures  on  various  forms  of surgery, including rhinoplasty, the
   repair  of  torn  ear lobes, perineal lithotomy, cataract surgery, and
   several other excisions and other surgical procedures.

   Metallurgy:  The  wootz, crucible and stainless steels were discovered
   in  India, and were widely exported in Classic Mediterranean world. It
   was  known  from Pliny the Elder as ferrum indicum. Indian Wootz steel
   was  held  in  high regard in Roman Empire, was often considered to be
   the best. After in Middle Age it was imported in Syria to produce with
   special techniques the "Damascus steel" by the year 1000.^[41]

     The   Hindus   excel  in  the  manufacture  of  iron,  and  in  the
     preparations  of  those ingredients along with which it is fused to
     obtain  that kind of soft iron which is usually styled Indian steel
     (Hindiah).  They  also  have  workshops wherein are forged the most
     famous sabres in the world.

   Mathematics:  From  the earliest the Chinese used a positional decimal
   system  on  counting  boards  in  order to calculate. To express 10, a
   single  rod  is  placed  in  the second box from the right. The spoken
   language  uses  a  similar  system  to English: e.g. four thousand two
   hundred  seven.  No  symbol  was used for zero. By the 1st century BC,
   negative  numbers  and  decimal  fractions  were  in  use and The Nine
   Chapters  on  the  Mathematical  Art  included  methods for extracting
   higher order roots by Horner's method and solving linear equations and
   by  Pythagoras'  theorem.  Cubic  equations  were  solved  in the Tang
   dynasty  and solutions of equations of order higher than 3 appeared in
   print  in  1245  AD by Ch'in Chiu-shao. Pascal's triangle for binomial
   coefficients was described around 1100 by Jia Xian.

   Although the first attempts at an axiomatisation of geometry appear in
   the  Mohist  canon  in  330 BC, Liu Hui developed algebraic methods in
   geometry in the 3rd century AD and also calculated pi to 5 significant
   figures.  In  480,  Zu Chongzhi improved this by discovering the ratio
   \tfrac{355}{113}  which  remained  the  most  accurate  value for 1200

   1092,   featuring   a   cylindrical  projection  similar  to  Mercator
   projection  and the corrected position of the pole star thanks to Shen
   Kuo's astronomical observations.^[43]

   Astronomy: Astronomical observations from China constitute the longest
   continuous  sequence  from  any  civilisation  and  include records of
   sunspots (112 records from 364 BC), supernovas (1054), lunar and solar
   eclipses.  By  the 12th century, they could reasonably accurately make
   predictions of eclipses, but the knowledge of this was lost during the
   Ming  dynasty,  so  that the Jesuit Matteo Ricci gained much favour in
   1601  by his predictions.^[44] By 635 Chinese astronomers had observed
   that the tails of comets always point away from the sun.

   From  antiquity,  the Chinese used an equatorial system for describing
   the  skies  and  a  star  map  from  940 was drawn using a cylindrical
   (Mercator) projection. The use of an armillary sphere is recorded from
   the 4th century BC and a sphere permanently mounted in equatorial axis
   from 52 BC. In 125 AD Zhang Heng used water power to rotate the sphere
   in  real  time.  This included rings for the meridian and ecliptic. By
   1270 they had incorporated the principles of the Arab torquetum.

   Seismology:  To  better  prepare for calamities, Zhang Heng invented a
   seismometer  in  132 CE which provided instant alert to authorities in
   the  capital  Luoyang  that  an  earthquake had occurred in a location
   indicated  by  a specific cardinal or ordinal direction.^[45] Although
   no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that
   an  earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon
   afterwards  that  an  earthquake  had indeed struck 400 km (248 mi) to
   500 km   (310 mi)   northwest  of  Luoyang  (in  what  is  now  modern
   Gansu).^[46] Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the
   seasonal  winds  and  the  movements  of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi
   ?????),  so-named  because he and others thought that earthquakes were
   most  likely  caused  by the enormous compression of trapped air.^[47]
   See Zhang's seismometer for further details.

   There  are  many  notable contributors to the field of Chinese science
   throughout  the  ages.  One  of  the  best  examples would be Shen Kuo
   (1031–1095),  a  polymath scientist and statesman who was the first to
   describe  the  magnetic-needle compass used for navigation, discovered
   the  concept  of  true  north, improved the design of the astronomical
   gnomon, armillary sphere, sight tube, and clepsydra, and described the
   use  of  drydocks to repair boats. After observing the natural process
   of  the  inundation  of  silt  and  the  find of marine fossils in the
   Taihang Mountains (hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo
   devised  a theory of land formation, or geomorphology. He also adopted
   a  theory  of  gradual  climate  change  in  regions  over time, after
   observing  petrified  bamboo  found  underground  at  Yan'an,  Shaanxi
   province.  If not for Shen Kuo's writing,^[48] the architectural works
   of  Yu  Hao  would be little known, along with the inventor of movable
   type  printing,  Bi  Sheng  (990-1051).  Shen's  contemporary  Su Song
   (1020–1101) was also a brilliant polymath, an astronomer who created a
   celestial  atlas  of  star  maps, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with
   related  subjects  of botany, zoology, mineralogy, and metallurgy, and
   had  erected  a large astronomical clocktower in Kaifeng city in 1088.
   To  operate  the crowning armillary sphere, his clocktower featured an
   escapement  mechanism  and  the world's oldest known use of an endless
   power-transmitting chain drive.

   The  Jesuit  China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries "learned to
   appreciate  the  scientific  achievements  of this ancient culture and
   made  them  known  in  Europe.  Through  their correspondence European
   scientists  first learned about the Chinese science and culture."^[49]
   Western  academic  thought  on  the  history of Chinese technology and
   science  was  galvanized by the work of Joseph Needham and the Needham
   Research  Institute.  Among the technological accomplishments of China
   were,  according  to  the British scholar Needham, early seismological
   detectors (Zhang Heng in the 2nd century), the water-powered celestial
   globe  (Zhang Heng), matches, the independent invention of the decimal
   system,  dry  docks,  sliding calipers, the double-action piston pump,
   cast  iron,  the  blast  furnace, the iron plough, the multi-tube seed
   drill,  the wheelbarrow, the suspension bridge, the winnowing machine,
   the  rotary fan, the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the raised-relief
   map,  the  propeller,  the  crossbow,  and  a  solid  fuel rocket, the
   multistage  rocket,  the  horse  collar,  along  with contributions in
   logic, astronomy, medicine, and other fields.

   However,  cultural  factors  prevented these Chinese achievements from
   developing  into  what  we  might  call "modern science". According to
   Needham, it may have been the religious and philosophical framework of
   Chinese  intellectuals  which  made them unable to accept the ideas of
   laws of nature:

     It  was  not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but
     rather  that  it  was  not an order ordained by a rational personal
     being,  and  hence  there  was no conviction that rational personal
     beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages
     the  divine  code  of  laws  which  he  had  decreed aforetime. The
     Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naïve
     for  the  subtlety  and complexity of the universe as they intuited
     it.^[50]

Science in the Middle Ages[edit]

   With  the  division of the Roman Empire, the Western Roman Empire lost
   contact  with  much  of its past. In the Middle East, Greek philosophy
   was  able  to  find  some support under the newly created Arab Empire.
   With  the  spread  of  Islam in the 7th and 8th centuries, a period of
   Muslim  scholarship, known as the Islamic Golden Age, lasted until the
   13th  century.  This scholarship was aided by several factors. The use
   of  a single language, Arabic, allowed communication without need of a
   translator.  Access  to  Greek  texts from the Byzantine Empire, along
   with  Indian sources of learning, provided Muslim scholars a knowledge
   base to build upon.

   While  the  Byzantine  Empire  still  held  learning  centers  such as
   Constantinople,   Western   Europe's  knowledge  was  concentrated  in
   monasteries until the development of medieval universities in the 12th
   and  13th  centuries.  The curriculum of monastic schools included the
   study of the few available ancient texts and of new works on practical
   subjects like medicine^[51] and timekeeping.^[52]

Islamic world[edit]

   Muslim  scientists  placed far greater emphasis on experiment than had
   the  Greeks.^[53]  This  led  to  an  early  scientific  method  being
   developed   in   the  Muslim  world,  where  significant  progress  in
   methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of Ibn al-Haytham
   (Alhazen)  on  optics  from c. 1000, in his Book of Optics. The law of
   refraction of light was known to the Persians.^[54] The most important
   development  of  the  scientific  method was the use of experiments to
   distinguish   between  competing  scientific  theories  set  within  a
   generally  empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists.
   Ibn  al-Haytham  is  also regarded as the father of optics, especially
   for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Some have
   also  described  Ibn  al-Haytham  as  the  "first  scientist"  for his
   development of the modern scientific method.^[55]

   In   mathematics,   the   Persian   mathematician  Muhammad  ibn  Musa
   al-Khwarizmi  gave his name to the concept of the algorithm, while the
   term  algebra  is  derived from al-jabr, the beginning of the title of
   one  of  his  publications.  What  is  now  known  as  Arabic numerals
   originally came from India, but Muslim mathematicians did make several
   refinements  to the number system, such as the introduction of decimal
   point  notation. Sabian mathematician Al-Battani (850-929) contributed
   to   astronomy   and   mathematics,   while  Persian  scholar  Al-Razi
   contributed to chemistry and medicine.

   In  astronomy,  Al-Battani  improved  the  measurements of Hipparchus,
   preserved  in  the  translation  of  Ptolemy's Hè Megalè Syntaxis (The
   great  treatise)  translated as Almagest. Al-Battani also improved the
   precision  of  the  measurement of the precession of the Earth's axis.
   The  corrections  made  to  the  geocentric  model  by al-Battani, Ibn
   al-Haytham,^[56]  Averroes  and  the Maragha astronomers such as Nasir
   al-Din  al-Tusi,  Mo'ayyeduddin  Urdi and Ibn al-Shatir are similar to
   Copernican  heliocentric  model.^[57]^[58]  Heliocentric  theories may
   have  also  been discussed by several other Muslim astronomers such as
   Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi,^[59] Abu-Rayhan Biruni, Abu
   Said al-Sijzi,^[60] Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, and Najm al-Din al-Qazwini
   al-Katibi.^[61]

   Muslim  chemists  and  alchemists  played  an  important  role  in the
   foundation  of modern chemistry. Scholars such as Will Durant^[62] and
   Fielding  H.  Garrison^[63]  considered  Muslim  chemists  to  be  the
   founders  of chemistry. In particular, Jabir ibn Hayyan is "considered
   by  many to be the father of chemistry".^[64]^[65] The works of Arabic
   scientists influenced Roger Bacon (who introduced the empirical method
   to   Europe,   strongly   influenced   by   his  reading  of  Persians
   writers),^[66] and later Isaac Newton.^[67]

   Ibn Sina (Avicenna) is regarded as the most influential philosopher of
   Islam.^[68] He pioneered the science of experimental medicine^[69] and
   was  the first physician to conduct clinical trials.^[70] His two most
   notable  works in medicine are the Kitab al-shifa? ("Book of Healing")
   and  The  Canon  of  Medicine,  both  of  which  were used as standard
   medicinal  texts  in both the Muslim world and in Europe well into the
   17th  century. Amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the
   contagious nature of infectious diseases,^[69] and the introduction of
   clinical pharmacology.^[71]

   Some  of  the  other  famous scientists from the Islamic world include
   al-Farabi    (polymath),   Abu   al-Qasim   al-Zahrawi   (pioneer   of
   surgery),^[72] Abu Rayhan al-Biruni (pioneer of Indology,^[73] geodesy
   and  anthropology),^[74]  Nasir  al-Din  al-Tusi  (polymath),  and Ibn
   Khaldun  (forerunner  of social sciences^[75] such as demography,^[76]
   cultural  history,^[77] historiography,^[78] philosophy of history and
   sociology),^[79] among many others.

   Islamic  science began its decline in the 12th or 13th century, before
   the  Renaissance  in  Europe, and due in part to the 11th–13th century
   Mongol conquests, during which libraries, observatories, hospitals and
   universities were destroyed.^[80] The end of the Islamic Golden Age is
   marked  by  the destruction of the intellectual center of Baghdad, the
   capital of the Abbasid caliphate in 1258.^[80]

Europe[edit]

   contributions to Medieval Europe
   Map of medieval universities.

   An  intellectual  revitalization  of  Europe started with the birth of
   medieval  universities  in  the  12th  century.  The  contact with the
   Islamic  world in Spain and Sicily, and during the Reconquista and the
   Crusades,  allowed  Europeans  access  to  scientific Greek and Arabic
   texts,  including  the  works of Aristotle, Ptolemy, Jabir ibn Hayyan,
   al-Khwarizmi,  Alhazen,  Avicenna, and Averroes. European scholars had
   access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo, who sponsored
   the  12th  century  Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin.
   Later  translators  like Michael Scotus would learn Arabic in order to
   study these texts directly. The European universities aided materially
   in  the  translation  and propagation of these texts and started a new
   infrastructure  which  was needed for scientific communities. In fact,
   European  university  put  many  works about the natural world and the
   study  of nature at the center of its curriculum,^[81] with the result
   that  the  "medieval  university  laid far greater emphasis on science
   than does its modern counterpart and descendent."^[82]

   As  well  as this, Europeans began to venture further and further east
   (most  notably, perhaps, Marco Polo) as a result of the Pax Mongolica.
   This led to the increased awareness of Indian and even Chinese culture
   and civilization within the European tradition. Technological advances
   were  also made, such as the early flight of Eilmer of Malmesbury (who
   had  studied  Mathematics  in  11th  century  England),^[83]  and  the
   metallurgical   achievements   of  the  Cistercian  blast  furnace  at
   Laskill.^[84]^[85]
   Statue of Roger Bacon at the Oxford University Museum.

   At  the  beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate
   Latin  translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually
   crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas
   via  both  the  universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural
   philosophy  contained  in  these texts began to be extended by notable
   scholastics  such  as Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus
   and   Duns   Scotus.  Precursors  of  the  modern  scientific  method,
   influenced  by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen
   already   in  Grosseteste's  emphasis  on  mathematics  as  a  way  to
   understand  nature,  and  in  the empirical approach admired by Bacon,
   particularly  in  his Opus Majus. Pierre Duhem's provocative thesis of
   the  Catholic  Church's  Condemnation  of  1277  led  to  the study of
   medieval science as a serious discipline, "but no one in the field any
   longer  endorses  his  view that modern science started in 1277".^[86]
   However,  many  scholars  agree with Duhem's view that the Middle Ages
   were a period of important scientific
   developments.^[87]^[88]^[89]^[90]

   The  first half of the 14th century saw much important scientific work
   being done, largely within the framework of scholastic commentaries on
   Aristotle's scientific writings.^[91] William of Ockham introduced the
   principle  of  parsimony:  natural  philosophers  should not postulate
   unnecessary  entities,  so  that motion is not a distinct thing but is
   only  the moving object^[92] and an intermediary "sensible species" is
   not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye.^[93] Scholars
   such as Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme started to reinterpret elements
   of  Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory
   that  impetus  was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a
   first  step  towards  the  modern  concept of inertia.^[94] The Oxford
   Calculators  began to mathematically analyze the kinematics of motion,
   making this analysis without considering the causes of motion.^[95]

   In  1348,  the  Black Death and other disasters sealed a sudden end to
   the previous period of massive philosophic and scientific development.
   Yet,  the  rediscovery of ancient texts was improved after the Fall of
   Constantinople  in  1453,  when  many  Byzantine  scholars had to seek
   refuge  in  the  West.  Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to
   have  great  effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination
   of  the  printed  word  democratized  learning  and  allowed  a faster
   propagation  of  new  ideas.  New  ideas  also helped to influence the
   development   of  European  science  at  this  point:  not  least  the
   introduction  of  Algebra.  These  developments  paved the way for the
   Scientific Revolution, which may also be understood as a resumption of
   the  process  of  scientific inquiry, halted at the start of the Black
   Death.

Impact of science in Europe[edit]

   Galileo Galilei, father of modern science.^[96]

   The  renewal  of  learning  in  Europe,  that  began with 12th century
   Scholasticism,  came  to an end about the time of the Black Death, and
   the  initial period of the subsequent Italian Renaissance is sometimes
   seen  as  a  lull in scientific activity. The Northern Renaissance, on
   the  other  hand,  showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian
   natural  philosophy  to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany,
   anatomy, and medicine).^[97] Thus modern science in Europe was resumed
   in a period of great upheaval: the Protestant Reformation and Catholic
   Counter-Reformation;  the  discovery  of  the  Americas by Christopher
   Columbus;  the  Fall  of  Constantinople; but also the re-discovery of
   Aristotle  during  the  Scholastic  period  presaged  large social and
   political  changes.  Thus, a suitable environment was created in which
   it  became  possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same
   way  that Martin Luther and John Calvin questioned religious doctrine.
   The  works  of Ptolemy (astronomy) and Galen (medicine) were found not
   always  to  match  everyday  observations.  Work  by Vesalius on human
   cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.^[98]

   The  willingness to question previously held truths and search for new
   answers  resulted  in  a  period of major scientific advancements, now
   known  as  the  Scientific  Revolution.  The  Scientific Revolution is
   traditionally  held by most historians to have begun in 1543, when the
   books  De  humani corporis fabrica (On the Workings of the Human Body)
   by  Andreas  Vesalius,  and  also De Revolutionibus, by the astronomer
   Nicolaus  Copernicus,  were  first  printed. The thesis of Copernicus'
   book  was  that  the Earth moved around the Sun. The period culminated
   with   the   publication   of   the  Philosophiæ  Naturalis  Principia
   Mathematica   in   1687   by   Isaac  Newton,  representative  of  the
   unprecedented growth of scientific publications throughout Europe.

   Other  significant  scientific  advances were made during this time by
   Galileo  Galilei,  Edmond  Halley,  Robert  Hooke, Christiaan Huygens,
   Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Gottfried Leibniz, and Blaise Pascal. In
   philosophy, major contributions were made by Francis Bacon, Sir Thomas
   Browne,  René  Descartes, and Thomas Hobbes. The scientific method was
   also  better  developed  as  the  modern  way  of  thinking emphasized
   experimentation and reason over traditional considerations.

   The  Age of Enlightenment was a European affair. The 17th century "Age
   of  Reason"  opened  the  avenues to the decisive steps towards modern
   science,   which   took   place   during  the  18th  century  "Age  of
   Enlightenment".   Directly   based   on  the  works^[101]  of  Newton,
   Descartes,   Pascal  and  Leibniz,  the  way  was  now  clear  to  the
   development  of  modern  mathematics,  physics  and  technology by the
   generation   of   Benjamin   Franklin   (1706–1790),   Leonhard  Euler
   (1707–1783), Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765) and Jean le Rond d'Alembert
   (1717–1783),   epitomized   in   the  appearance  of  Denis  Diderot's
   Encyclopédie between 1751 and 1772. The impact of this process was not
   limited  to  science and technology, but affected philosophy (Immanuel
   Kant,  David  Hume),  religion (the increasingly significant impact of
   science  upon  religion),  and  society  and politics in general (Adam
   Smith,  Voltaire),  the  French  Revolution  of  1789 setting a bloody
   cesura  indicating  the  beginning  of  political  modernity^[citation
   needed].  The  early  modern  period  is  seen  as  a flowering of the
   European  Renaissance,  in  what  is  often  known  as  the Scientific
   Revolution, viewed as a foundation of modern science.^[102]

Romanticism in science[edit]

   Main article: Romanticism in science

   The  Romantic  Movement  of the early 19th century reshaped science by
   opening  up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the
   Enlightenment.  Major  breakthroughs  came  in  biology, especially in
   Darwin's  theory  of evolution, as well as physics (electromagnetism),
   mathematics  (non-Euclidean  geometry,  group  theory)  and  chemistry
   (organic chemistry). The decline of Romanticism occurred because a new
   movement,  Positivism,  began  to  take  hold  of  the  ideals  of the
   intellectuals after 1840 and lasted until about 1880.

   The  scientific  revolution  established  science  as a source for the
   growth  of  knowledge.^[103]  During the 19th century, the practice of
   science  became  professionalized  and  institutionalized in ways that
   continued  through  the  20th  century.  As  the  role  of  scientific
   knowledge grew in society, it became incorporated with many aspects of
   the functioning of nation-states.

   The  history of science is marked by a chain of advances in technology
   and  knowledge that have always complemented each other. Technological
   innovations  bring  about  new  discoveries  and  are  bred  by  other
   discoveries,   which  inspire  new  possibilities  and  approaches  to
   longstanding science issues.

Natural sciences[edit]

Physics[edit]

   Main article: History of physics
   Albert Einstein
   James Clerk Maxwell

   The  scientific  revolution  is  a convenient boundary between ancient
   thought   and  classical  physics.  Nicolaus  Copernicus  revived  the
   heliocentric  model  of  the  solar system described by Aristarchus of
   Samos.  This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion
   given  by  Johannes  Kepler  in the early 17th century, which proposed
   that  the  planets follow elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus
   of  the ellipse. Galileo ("Father of Modern Physics") also made use of
   experiments  to  validate  physical  theories,  a  key  element of the
   scientific method.

   In  1687,  Isaac Newton published the Principia Mathematica, detailing
   two  comprehensive  and successful physical theories: Newton's laws of
   motion,  which  led  to  classical  mechanics;  and  Newton's  Law  of
   Gravitation,  which  describes  the  fundamental force of gravity. The
   behavior of electricity and magnetism was studied by Faraday, Ohm, and
   others  during  the  early  19th  century.  These  studies  led to the
   unification   of   the   two   phenomena   into  a  single  theory  of
   electromagnetism,   by   James   Clerk  Maxwell  (known  as  Maxwell's
   equations).

   The beginning of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in
   physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct
   in  all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, Max Planck, Albert Einstein,
   Niels  Bohr  and  others developed quantum theories to explain various
   anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels.
   Not  only  did  quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not
   hold  on  small  scales,  but  even  more  disturbingly, the theory of
   general  relativity,  proposed  by  Einstein  in 1915, showed that the
   fixed  background  of spacetime, on which both Newtonian mechanics and
   special   relativity  depended,  could  not  exist.  In  1925,  Werner
   Heisenberg  and  Erwin Schrödinger formulated quantum mechanics, which
   explained  the  preceding  quantum  theories. The observation by Edwin
   Hubble  in  1929  that  the  speed at which galaxies recede positively
   correlates  with  their  distance,  led  to the understanding that the
   universe  is  expanding, and the formulation of the Big Bang theory by
   Georges Lemaître.
   The atomic bomb ushered in "Big Science" in physics.

   In 1938 Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission with
   radiochemical methods, and in 1939 Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch
   wrote  the  first  theoretical  interpretation of the fission process,
   which  was  later  improved by Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler. Further
   developments  took  place  during  World  War  II,  which  led  to the
   practical  application  of  radar  and  the development and use of the
   atomic  bomb.  Though  the process had begun with the invention of the
   cyclotron  by  Ernest O. Lawrence in the 1930s, physics in the postwar
   period  entered  into  a  phase  of  what  historians have called "Big
   Science",  requiring  massive  machines,  budgets, and laboratories in
   order  to test their theories and move into new frontiers. The primary
   patron  of  physics  became state governments, who recognized that the
   support of "basic" research could often lead to technologies useful to
   both   military   and   industrial  applications.  Currently,  general
   relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other, and
   efforts are underway to unify the two.

Chemistry[edit]

   Main article: History of chemistry
   Dmitri Mendeleev

   Modern  chemistry  emerged  from  the sixteenth through the eighteenth
   centuries  through  the  material  practices  and theories promoted by
   alchemy,  medicine,  manufacturing and mining.^[104] A decisive moment
   came  when  'chymistry' was distinguished from alchemy by Robert Boyle
   in  his  work  The Sceptical Chymist, in 1661; although the alchemical
   tradition  continued  for  some  time  after his work. Other important
   steps  included  the  gravimetric  experimental  practices  of medical
   chemists like William Cullen, Joseph Black, Torbern Bergman and Pierre
   Macquer  and  through  the work of Antoine Lavoisier (Father of Modern
   Chemistry)  on  oxygen  and  the  law  of  conservation of mass, which
   refuted  phlogiston  theory.  The  theory  that  all matter is made of
   atoms,  which  are  the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be
   broken  down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties
   of  that  matter,  was  provided  by John Dalton in 1803, although the
   question  took  a  hundred  years  to  settle  as  proven. Dalton also
   formulated  the  law  of mass relationships. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev
   composed  his  periodic  table  of  elements  on the basis of Dalton's
   discoveries.

   The synthesis of urea by Friedrich Wöhler opened a new research field,
   organic chemistry, and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were
   able  to  synthesize  hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of
   the  19th  century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals,
   after  the  exhaustion  of  the  oil  supply from whaling. By the 20th
   century,  systematic  production of refined materials provided a ready
   supply  of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic
   materials  for  clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources.
   Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms
   resulted  in  physiological  chemistry, the precursor to biochemistry.
   The  20th  century  also saw the integration of physics and chemistry,
   with  chemical  properties  explained  as the result of the electronic
   structure  of  the  atom.  Linus  Pauling's  book on The Nature of the
   Chemical  Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond
   angles  in  ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated
   in  the physical modelling of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of
   Francis  Crick,  1953).  In  the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment
   demonstrated  in  a  simulation  of  primordial  processes, that basic
   constituents  of  proteins,  simple  amino  acids, could themselves be
   built up from simpler molecules.

Geology[edit]

   Main article: History of geology

   Geology  existed  as  a  cloud  of  isolated, disconnected ideas about
   rocks,  minerals,  and  landforms  long  before  it  became a coherent
   science.   Theophrastus'   work   on   rocks,  Peri  lithon,  remained
   authoritative  for  millennia:  its  interpretation of fossils was not
   overturned  until  after  the  Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath
   Shen  Kua  (1031–1095)  first formulated hypotheses for the process of
   land  formation.  Based  on his observation of fossils in a geological
   stratum  in  a  mountain  hundreds of miles from the ocean, he deduced
   that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition
   of silt.
   Plate  tectonics—seafloor  spreading and continental drift illustrated
   on a relief globe

   Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the Scientific
   Revolution,  but  individual  theorists  made important contributions.
   Robert  Hooke,  for  example,  formulated a theory of earthquakes, and
   Nicholas  Steno  developed the theory of superposition and argued that
   fossils  were  the  remains  of  once-living creatures. Beginning with
   Thomas   Burnet's   Sacred  Theory  of  the  Earth  in  1681,  natural
   philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over
   time.  Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth's past in terms
   of events described in the Bible, but their work laid the intellectual
   foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history.
   James Hutton, the father of modern geology

   Modern  geology,  like  modern chemistry, gradually evolved during the
   18th  and  early  19th  centuries.  Benoît de Maillet and the Comte de
   Buffon  saw the Earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by
   biblical  scholars.  Jean-Étienne Guettard and Nicolas Desmarest hiked
   central  France  and  recorded their observations on some of the first
   geological  maps.  Aided by chemical experimentation, naturalists such
   as   Scotland's  John  Walker,^[105]  Sweden's  Torbern  Bergman,  and
   Germany's  Abraham Werner created comprehensive classification systems
   for  rocks  and  minerals—a  collective  achievement  that transformed
   geology  into  a  cutting  edge  field  by  the  end of the eighteenth
   century.   These   early   geologists   also  proposed  a  generalized
   interpretations of Earth history that led James Hutton, Georges Cuvier
   and  Alexandre  Brongniart,  following in the steps of Steno, to argue
   that  layers  of  rock could be dated by the fossils they contained: a
   principle  first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of
   index  fossils  became  a  powerful  tool  for making geological maps,
   because  it  allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality
   with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first
   half  of  the  19th  century,  geologists  such as Charles Lyell, Adam
   Sedgwick,  and  Roderick  Murchison applied the new technique to rocks
   throughout  Europe  and  eastern  North America, setting the stage for
   more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades.

   Midway  through  the  19th  century, the focus of geology shifted from
   description  and  classification  to  attempts  to  understand how the
   surface  of the Earth had changed. The first comprehensive theories of
   mountain  building were proposed during this period, as were the first
   modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. Louis Agassiz and others
   established   the   reality   of   continent-covering  ice  ages,  and
   "fluvialists"  like  Andrew  Crombie  Ramsay argued that river valleys
   were  formed,  over  millions of years by the rivers that flow through
   them. After the discovery of radioactivity, radiometric dating methods
   were  developed, starting in the 20th century. Alfred Wegener's theory
   of "continental drift" was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the
   1910s,  but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory
   of plate tectonics, which provided a plausible mechanism for it. Plate
   tectonics  also  provided  a  unified  explanation for a wide range of
   seemingly  unrelated geological phenomena. Since 1970 it has served as
   the unifying principle in geology.

   Geologists'  embrace of plate tectonics became part of a broadening of
   the field from a study of rocks into a study of the Earth as a planet.
   Other  elements of this transformation include: geophysical studies of
   the  interior  of  the Earth, the grouping of geology with meteorology
   and  oceanography  as  one of the "earth sciences", and comparisons of
   Earth and the solar system's other rocky planets.

Astronomy[edit]

   Main article: History of astronomy

   Aristarchus  of Samos published work on how to determine the sizes and
   distances  of the Sun and the Moon, and Eratosthenes used this work to
   figure  the  size  of  the  Earth.  Hipparchus  later  discovered  the
   precession of the Earth.

   Advances  in  astronomy  and  in  optical  systems in the 19th century
   resulted  in  the  first observation of an asteroid (1 Ceres) in 1801,
   and the discovery of Neptune in 1846.

   George  Gamow,  Ralph  Alpher,  and  Robert Herman had calculated that
   there  should be evidence for a Big Bang in the background temperature
   of  the  universe.^[106] In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson^[107]
   discovered   a   3 Kelvin   background   hiss   in   their  Bell  Labs
   radiotelescope (the Holmdel Horn Antenna), which was evidence for this
   hypothesis,  and  formed the basis for a number of results that helped
   determine the age of the universe.

   Supernova  SN1987A was observed by astronomers on Earth both visually,
   and  in  a  triumph  for  neutrino  astronomy,  by  the solar neutrino
   detectors at Kamiokande. But the solar neutrino flux was a fraction of
   its  theoretically expected value. This discrepancy forced a change in
   some values in the standard model for particle physics.

Biology, medicine and genetics[edit]

   Semi-conservative DNA replication

   In  1847,  Hungarian  physician  Ignác  Fülöp  Semmelweis dramatically
   reduced   the  occurrency  of  puerperal  fever  by  simply  requiring
   physicians   to   wash  their  hands  before  attending  to  women  in
   childbirth.  This  discovery  predated  the  germ  theory  of disease.
   However,   Semmelweis'   findings   were   not   appreciated   by  his
   contemporaries  and  came  into  use  only with discoveries by British
   surgeon   Joseph   Lister,  who  in  1865  proved  the  principles  of
   antisepsis.  Lister's  work  was  based  on  the important findings by
   French   biologist   Louis   Pasteur.   Pasteur   was   able  to  link
   microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised
   one of the most important methods in preventive medicine, when in 1880
   he  produced a vaccine against rabies. Pasteur invented the process of
   pasteurization, to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and
   other foods.^[108]

   Perhaps  the  most prominent, controversial and far-reaching theory in
   all  of  science has been the theory of evolution by natural selection
   put  forward  by  the British naturalist Charles Darwin in his book On
   the  Origin  of  Species in 1859. Darwin proposed that the features of
   all  living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes
   over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form
   affects  almost  all areas of biology.^[109] Implications of evolution
   on  fields  outside  of  pure  science have led to both opposition and
   support from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the
   popular  understanding  of "man's place in the universe". In the early
   20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after
   the  rediscovery  in  1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the
   Moravian^[110]  monk Gregor Mendel in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the
   beginnings  of  the  study  of genetics, which became a major field of
   research  for  both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, James
   D.  Watson,  Francis  Crick  and  Maurice  Wilkins clarified the basic
   structure  of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its
   forms.^[111]  In  the  late 20th century, the possibilities of genetic
   engineering  became  practical  for  the  first  time,  and  a massive
   international  effort  began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome
   (the Human Genome Project).

Ecology[edit]

   Main article: History of ecology
   Earthrise  over  the  Moon,  Apollo  8, NASA. This image helped create
   awareness  of  the  finiteness of Earth, and the limits of its natural
   resources.

   The discipline of ecology typically traces its origin to the synthesis
   of  Darwinian evolution and Humboldtian biogeography, in the late 19th
   and  early  20th  centuries. Equally important in the rise of ecology,
   however,  were microbiology and soil science—particularly the cycle of
   life  concept, prominent in the work Louis Pasteur and Ferdinand Cohn.
   The  word  ecology  was  coined  by  Ernst Haeckel, whose particularly
   holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular)
   was  important  in  the  spread  of ecological thinking. In the 1930s,
   Arthur  Tansley  and  others  began  developing the field of ecosystem
   ecology,  which  combined experimental soil science with physiological
   concepts of energy and the techniques of field biology. The history of
   ecology   in   the   20th   century   is   closely  tied  to  that  of
   environmentalism;  the Gaia hypothesis, first formulated in the 1960s,
   and spreading in the 1970s, and more recently the scientific-religious
   movement of Deep Ecology have brought the two closer together.

Social sciences[edit]

   Main article: History of the social sciences

   Successful  use  of the scientific method in the physical sciences led
   to  the  same  methodology being adapted to better understand the many
   fields  of  human  endeavor. From this effort the social sciences have
   been developed.

Political science[edit]

   Main article: History of political science

   Political   science   is   a   late   arrival   in   terms  of  social
   sciences^[citation needed]. However, the discipline has a clear set of
   antecedents  such as moral philosophy, political philosophy, political
   economy,   history,   and   other   fields  concerned  with  normative
   determinations   of   what   ought   to   be  and  with  deducing  the
   characteristics  and  functions  of  the ideal form of government. The
   roots  of  politics  are in prehistory. In each historic period and in
   almost  every  geographic  area, we can find someone studying politics
   and increasing political understanding.

   In  Western  culture,  the study of politics is first found in Ancient
   Greece.  The  antecedents  of European politics trace their roots back
   even  earlier  than  Plato and Aristotle, particularly in the works of
   Homer,  Hesiod,  Thucydides,  Xenophon,  and  Euripides.  Later, Plato
   analyzed  political  systems,  abstracted  their  analysis  from  more
   literary-  and  history-  oriented  studies and applied an approach we
   would  understand  as closer to philosophy. Similarly, Aristotle built
   upon  Plato's analysis to include historical empirical evidence in his
   analysis.

   An ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy and military
   strategy    by   Kautilya^[112]   and   Vi?h?ugupta,^[113]   who   are
   traditionally  identified  with  Cha?akya  (c.  350–-283 BCE). In this
   treatise, the behaviors and relationships of the people, the King, the
   State,  the  Government Superintendents, Courtiers, Enemies, Invaders,
   and  Corporations are analysed and documented. Roger Boesche describes
   the  Arthasastra as "a book of political realism, a book analysing how
   the  political world does work and not very often stating how it ought
   to  work,  a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating
   and  sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state
   and the common good."^[114]

   During  the rule of Rome, famous historians such as Polybius, Livy and
   Plutarch   documented   the  rise  of  the  Roman  Republic,  and  the
   organization  and  histories  of  other  nations, while statesmen like
   Julius  Caesar,  Cicero  and  others  provided us with examples of the
   politics  of  the  republic  and  Rome's empire and wars. The study of
   politics  during  this  age was oriented toward understanding history,
   understanding  methods  of  governing, and describing the operation of
   governments.

   With  the fall of the Western Roman Empire, there arose a more diffuse
   arena  for political studies. The rise of monotheism and, particularly
   for  the Western tradition, Christianity, brought to light a new space
   for politics and political action^[citation needed]. During the Middle
   Ages, the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts.
   Works such as Augustine of Hippo's The City of God synthesized current
   philosophies  and  political  traditions  with  those of Christianity,
   redefining  the  borders  between  what  was  religious  and  what was
   political.   Most   of   the   political   questions  surrounding  the
   relationship  between Church and State were clarified and contested in
   this period.

   In  the  Middle  East and later other Islamic areas, works such as the
   Rubaiyat  of  Omar  Khayyam  and  Epic  of  Kings by Ferdowsi provided
   evidence  of  political analysis, while the Islamic Aristotelians such
   as  Avicenna  and later Maimonides and Averroes, continued Aristotle's
   tradition   of   analysis  and  empiricism,  writing  commentaries  on
   Aristotle's works.

   During  the  Italian  Renaissance, Niccolò Machiavelli established the
   emphasis  of  modern political science on direct empirical observation
   of  political  institutions  and  actors.  Later, the expansion of the
   scientific  paradigm during the Enlightenment further pushed the study
   of  politics  beyond  normative  determinations^[citation  needed]. In
   particular,  the  study  of  statistics,  to study the subjects of the
   state, has been applied to polling and voting.

   In  the  20th  century,  the  study  of  ideology,  behaviouralism and
   international relations led to a multitude of 'pol-sci' subdisciplines
   including  rational  choice  theory,  voting theory, game theory (also
   used   in  economics),  psephology,  political  geography/geopolitics,
   political  psychology/political  sociology,  political economy, policy
   analysis,  public  administration,  comparative political analysis and
   peace studies/conflict analysis.

Linguistics[edit]

   Main article: History of linguistics

   Historical linguistics emerged as an independent field of study at the
   end  of  the  18th  century. Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit,
   Persian,  Greek,  Latin,  Gothic,  and  Celtic  languages all shared a
   common  base.  After  Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the
   world  was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century.
   Publication  of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique générale
   created   the  development  of  descriptive  linguistics.  Descriptive
   linguistics, and the related structuralism movement caused linguistics
   to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing
   the  differences  between  languages. Noam Chomsky further diversified
   linguistics  with  the  development  of  generative linguistics in the
   1950s.  His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that
   allows  for the description and prediction of valid syntax. Additional
   specialties  such  as  sociolinguistics,  cognitive  linguistics,  and
   computational  linguistics  have  emerged  from  collaboration between
   linguistics and other disciplines.

Economics[edit]

   Main article: History of economics
   The supply and demand model
   Adam  Smith  wrote  The  Wealth  of  Nations, the first modern work of
   economics

   The  basis  for classical economics forms Adam Smith's An Inquiry into
   the  Nature  and  Causes  of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776.
   Smith  criticized mercantilism, advocating a system of free trade with
   division  of  labour. He postulated an "invisible hand" that regulated
   economic  systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. Karl
   Marx   developed   an  alternative  economic  theory,  called  Marxian
   economics. Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and
   assumes  the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required
   to  produce  it.  Under  this  assumption,  capitalism  was  based  on
   employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit.
   The   Austrian  school  responded  to  Marxian  economics  by  viewing
   entrepreneurship  as  driving  force  of  economic  development.  This
   replaced the labor theory of value by a system of supply and demand.

   In  the  1920s,  John  Maynard  Keynes  prompted  a  division  between
   microeconomics   and   macroeconomics.   Under   Keynesian   economics
   macroeconomic   trends   can   overwhelm   economic  choices  made  by
   individuals.  Governments should promote aggregate demand for goods as
   a  means  to  encourage  economic  expansion.  Following World War II,
   Milton  Friedman created the concept of monetarism. Monetarism focuses
   on  using  the  supply and demand of money as a method for controlling
   economic   activity.   In  the  1970s,  monetarism  has  adapted  into
   supply-side  economics  which  advocates  reducing taxes as a means to
   increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.

   Other  modern  schools of economic thought are New Classical economics
   and  New Keynesian economics. New Classical economics was developed in
   the   1970s,   emphasizing  solid  microeconomics  as  the  basis  for
   macroeconomic growth. New Keynesian economics was created partially in
   response to New Classical economics, and deals with how inefficiencies
   in  the  market  create  a  need  for  control  by  a  central bank or
   government.

   The  above  "history  of economics" reflects modern economic textbooks
   and  this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the
   culmination   of  its  history  (Kuhn,  1962).  The  "invisible  hand"
   mentioned  in  a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of
   the  to  "Wealth  of  Nations",  1776,  advances  as  Smith's  central
   message.^[clarification needed] It is played down that this "invisible
   hand"  acts  only  "frequently"  and  that  it is "no part of his [the
   individual's] intentions" because competition leads to lower prices by
   imitating  "his"  invention.  That  this "invisible hand" prefers "the
   support  of  domestic  to  foreign industry" is cleansed—often without
   indication  that  part of the citation is truncated.^[115] The opening
   passage  of the "Wealth" containing Smith's message is never mentioned
   as it cannot be integrated into modern theory: "Wealth" depends on the
   division  of  labour  which  changes  with  market  volume  and on the
   proportion of productive to Unproductive labor.

Psychology[edit]

   Main article: History of psychology

   The  end  of  the  19th  century  marks  the  start of psychology as a
   scientific  enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of
   psychology  as  an  independent  field  of study. In that year Wilhelm
   Wundt   founded   the   first   laboratory  dedicated  exclusively  to
   psychological   research   (in   Leipzig).   Other   important   early
   contributors  to  the  field  include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in
   memory  studies), Ivan Pavlov (who discovered classical conditioning),
   William James, and Sigmund Freud. Freud's influence has been enormous,
   though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.

   The  20th  century  saw  a  rejection of Freud's theories as being too
   unscientific,  and  a  reaction  against  Edward Titchener's atomistic
   approach  of  the  mind. This led to the formulation of behaviorism by
   John  B.  Watson,  which  was popularized by B.F. Skinner. Behaviorism
   proposed  epistemologically  limiting  psychological  study  to  overt
   behavior,  since that could be reliably measured. Scientific knowledge
   of  the  "mind"  was  considered too metaphysical, hence impossible to
   achieve.

   The  final  decades  of  the  20th century have seen the rise of a new
   interdisciplinary   approach   to  studying  human  psychology,  known
   collectively  as  cognitive science. Cognitive science again considers
   the   mind  as  a  subject  for  investigation,  using  the  tools  of
   psychology,    linguistics,    computer   science,   philosophy,   and
   neurobiology.  New  methods  of visualizing the activity of the brain,
   such  as  PET  scans  and CAT scans, began to exert their influence as
   well,   leading   some   researchers   to   investigate  the  mind  by
   investigating  the  brain,  rather  than cognition. These new forms of
   investigation  assume  that  a wide understanding of the human mind is
   possible,  and  that  such  an  understanding  may be applied to other
   research domains, such as artificial intelligence.

Sociology[edit]

   Main article: History of sociology

   Ibn  Khaldun  can  be  regarded  as the earliest scientific systematic
   sociologist.^[116]  The  modern  sociology,  emerged in the early 19th
   century  as  the  academic response to the modernization of the world.
   Among  many  early  sociologists  (e.g.,  Émile  Durkheim), the aim of
   sociology  was  in structuralism, understanding the cohesion of social
   groups,  and  developing  an  "antidote" to social disintegration. Max
   Weber  was  concerned  with  the  modernization of society through the
   concept  of  rationalization, which he believed would trap individuals
   in  an  "iron  cage" of rational thought. Some sociologists, including
   Georg  Simmel  and  W. E. B. Du Bois, utilized more microsociological,
   qualitative  analyses.  This  microlevel  approach played an important
   role  in  American sociology, with the theories of George Herbert Mead
   and  his  student  Herbert  Blumer  resulting  in  the creation of the
   symbolic interactionism approach to sociology.

   American  sociology  in  the  1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by
   Talcott  Parsons,  who  argued  that  aspects of society that promoted
   structural  integration  were  therefore "functional". This structural
   functionalism  approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists
   came  to  see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities
   present in the status quo. In reaction, conflict theory was developed,
   which  was  based  in  part on the philosophies of Karl Marx. Conflict
   theorists  saw  society  as an arena in which different groups compete
   for  control  over  resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be
   regarded  as  central  to  sociological  thinking.  Erving Goffman saw
   social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing
   "backstage"   and   attempting   to  control  their  audience  through
   impression management. While these theories are currently prominent in
   sociological  thought,  other  approaches  exist,  including  feminist
   theory, post-structuralism, rational choice theory, and postmodernism.

Anthropology[edit]

   Main article: History of anthropology

   Anthropology  can  best  be  understood  as an outgrowth of the Age of
   Enlightenment.  It  was  during  this  period that Europeans attempted
   systematically  to study human behaviour. Traditions of jurisprudence,
   history,  philology  and  sociology  developed  during  this  time and
   informed  the development of the social sciences of which anthropology
   was a part.

   At  the same time, the romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced
   thinkers  such  as  Johann  Gottfried Herder and later Wilhelm Dilthey
   whose  work  formed the basis for the culture concept which is central
   to  the  discipline. Traditionally, much of the history of the subject
   was  based  on colonial encounters between Western Europe and the rest
   of  the  world, and much of 18th- and 19th-century anthropology is now
   classed as forms of scientific racism.

   During  the  late  19th-century,  battles over the "study of man" took
   place  between  those  of  an "anthropological" persuasion (relying on
   anthropometrical techniques) and those of an "ethnological" persuasion
   (looking  at  cultures  and traditions), and these distinctions became
   part  of  the  later divide between physical anthropology and cultural
   anthropology, the latter ushered in by the students of Franz Boas.

   In  the  mid-20th  century,  much  of  the  methodologies  of  earlier
   anthropological  and ethnographical study were reevaluated with an eye
   towards  research  ethics,  while  at  the  same  time  the  scope  of
   investigation  has  broadened  far  beyond  the  traditional  study of
   "primitive  cultures" (scientific practice itself is often an arena of
   anthropological study).

   The  emergence  of  paleoanthropology,  a  scientific discipline which
   draws  on the methodologies of paleontology, physical anthropology and
   ethology,  among  other  disciplines,  and  increasing  in  scope  and
   momentum  from  the  mid-20th  century,  continues  to  yield  further
   insights into human origins, evolution, genetic and cultural heritage,
   and perspectives on the contemporary human predicament as well.

Emerging disciplines[edit]

   During  the  20th  century,  a  number of interdisciplinary scientific
   fields have emerged. These examples include:

   Communication   studies  combines  animal  communication,  information
   theory,  marketing,  public  relations,  telecommunications  and other
   forms of communication.

   Computer  science, built upon a foundation of theoretical linguistics,
   discrete  mathematics,  and electrical engineering, studies the nature
   and   limits   of   computation.   Subfields   include  computability,
   computational   complexity,   database  design,  computer  networking,
   artificial intelligence, and the design of computer hardware. One area
   in  which  advances  in  computing  have  contributed  to more general
   scientific  development  is  by  facilitating large-scale archiving of
   scientific data. Contemporary computer science typically distinguishes
   itself  by  emphasising  mathematical  'theory'  in  contrast  to  the
   practical emphasis of software engineering.

   Environmental science is an interdisciplinary field. It draws upon the
   disciplines of biology, chemistry, earth sciences, ecology, geography,
   mathematics, and physics.

   Materials  science  has  its  roots  in  metallurgy,  mineralogy,  and
   crystallography.   It   combines   chemistry,   physics,  and  several
   engineering  disciplines.  The  field studies metals, ceramics, glass,
   plastics, semiconductors, and composite materials.

Academic study[edit]

   Main article: History of science and technology

   As an academic field, history of science began with the publication of
   William  Whewell's  History of the Inductive Sciences (first published
   in  1837).  A  more  formal  study  of  the  history  of science as an
   independent  discipline  was launched by George Sarton's publications,
   Introduction  to  the  History  of Science (1927) and the Isis journal
   (founded  in  1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of
   the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He
   shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as
   a  record  of  the  advances  and delays in the march of progress. The
   history  of  science was not a recognized subfield of American history
   in  this  period,  and  most of the work was carried out by interested
   scientists  and  physicians rather than professional historians.^[117]
   With  the  work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard, the history of science
   became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.^[118]

   The  history  of  mathematics,  history  of technology, and history of
   philosophy  are  distinct  areas  of research and are covered in other
   articles.  Mathematics is closely related to but distinct from natural
   science  (at  least  in the modern conception). Technology is likewise
   closely  related  to but clearly differs from the search for empirical
   truth.

   History  of  science  is an academic discipline, with an international
   community  of  specialists.  Main  professional organizations for this
   field  include the History of Science Society, the British Society for
   the  History  of  Science, and the European Society for the History of
   Science.

Theories and sociology of the history of science[edit]

   Main article: Theories and sociology of the history of science

   Much  of  the  study  of  the  history  of science has been devoted to
   answering  questions  about  what  science  is,  how it functions, and
   whether   it  exhibits  large-scale  patterns  and  trends.^[119]  The
   sociology  of  science  in particular has focused on the ways in which
   scientists  work,  looking closely at the ways in which they "produce"
   and  "construct" scientific knowledge. Since the 1960s, a common trend
   in science studies (the study of the sociology and history of science)
   has  been  to emphasize the "human component" of scientific knowledge,
   and  to  de-emphasize  the view that scientific data are self-evident,
   value-free,   and   context-free.^[120]   The  field  of  Science  and
   Technology Studies, an area that overlaps and often informs historical
   studies  of  science, focuses on the social context of science in both
   contemporary and historical periods.

   Humboldtian  science  refers  to  the  early  19th century approach of
   combining   scientific   field   work  with  the  age  of  Romanticism
   sensitivity,  ethics  and aesthetic ideals.^[121] It helped to install
   natural  history  as  a  separate field, gave base for ecology and was
   based  on  the  role  model  of  scientist,  naturalist  and  explorer
   Alexander  von  Humboldt.^[122]  The  later  19th  century  positivism
   asserted that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all
   authentic   knowledge   assumes  that  the  only  valid  knowledge  is
   scientific.^[123]

   A  major  subject  of  concern  and  controversy  in the philosophy of
   science  has  been the nature of theory change in science. Karl Popper
   argued that scientific knowledge is progressive and cumulative; Thomas
   Kuhn, that scientific knowledge moves through "paradigm shifts" and is
   not  necessarily  progressive;  and  Paul  Feyerabend, that scientific
   knowledge  is  not  cumulative or progressive and that there can be no
   demarcation  in  terms of method between science and any other form of
   investigation.^[124]

   The  mid  20th  century saw a series of studies relying to the role of
   science in a social context, starting from Thomas Kuhn's The Structure
   of  Scientific  Revolutions in 1962. It opened the study of science to
   new  disciplines  by  suggesting  that the evolution of science was in
   part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the
   actual  interactions  and  strategies  of  the  human  participants in
   science.  As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in
   more  nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual
   systems  in  a  wider  matrix  that  includes  intellectual, cultural,
   economic and political themes outside of science. "Partly by selection
   and   partly  by  distortion,  the  scientists  of  earlier  ages  are
   implicitly  presented  as  having  worked  upon  the same set of fixed
   problems  and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the
   most  recent  revolution  in  scientific  theory  and method made seem
   scientific."^[125]

   Further  studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its
   Social Problems referred to the role of the scientific community, as a
   social  construct,  in  accepting  or rejecting (objective) scientific
   knowledge.^[126] The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence
   of  especially  French  philosophers,  which denied the objectivity of
   science  in  general  or  seemed  to  do  so.  They  described as well
   differences  between  the  idealized  model  of a pure science and the
   actual   scientific  practice;  while  scientism,  a  revival  of  the
   positivism   approach,   saw   in  precise  measurement  and  rigorous
   calculation  the  basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and
   moral  controversies.^[127]^[128]  However,  more recently some of the
   leading  critical  theorists  have  recognized  that  their postmodern
   deconstructions   have  at  times  been  counter-productive,  and  are
   providing  intellectual  ammunition  for  reactionary interests. Bruno
   Latour  noted  that  "dangerous  extremists  are  using  the very same
   argument  of  social  construction  to  destroy hard-won evidence that
   could  save  our lives. Was I wrong to participate in the invention of
   this  field  known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did
   not really mean what we meant?"^[129]

History of medicine

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: navigation, search
   This  article  is  about  the  history  of human medicine. For that of
   veterinary medicine, see History of veterinary medicine.
   The  Hippocratic  Corpus  is  a collection of early medical works from
   ancient  Greece  that  is  strongly  associated with the ancient Greek
   physician Hippocrates and his teachings.

   This article deals with medicine as practiced by trained professionals
   from  ancient  times  to the present. Early medical traditions include
   those  of  Babylon,  China,  Egypt  and  India.  The  Greeks went even
   further, introducing the concepts of medical diagnosis, prognosis, and
   advanced  medical  ethics. The Hippocratic Oath, still taken (although
   significantly  changed  from the original) by doctors up to today, was
   written  in  Greece  in  the  5th  century  BCE.  In the medieval age,
   surgical  practices  inherited  from the ancient masters were improved
   and   then   systematized  in  Rogerius's  The  Practice  of  Surgery.
   Universities  began systematic training of physicians around the years
   1220  in  Italy.  During  the  Renaissance,  understanding  of anatomy
   improved,  and the microscope was invented. The germ theory of disease
   in  the  19th  century  led  to  cures  for  many infectious diseases.
   Military doctors advanced the methods of trauma treatment and surgery.
   Public  health  measures were developed especially in the 19th century
   as  the  rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures.
   Advanced  research  centers  opened  in  the early 20th century, often
   connected with major hospitals. The mid-20th century was characterized
   by new biological treatments, such as antibiotics. These advancements,
   along  with  developments  in  chemistry, genetics, and lab technology
   (such  as  the  x-ray)  led  to  modern medicine. Medicine was heavily
   professionalized  in the 20th century, and new careers opened to women
   as  nurses (from the 1870s) and as physicians (especially after 1970).
   The   21st  century  is  characterized  by  highly  advanced  research
   involving numerous fields of science.

Prehistoric medicine[edit]

   Main article: Prehistoric medicine

   Although  there  is no record to establish when plants were first used
   for  medicinal  purposes  (herbalism),  the  use  of plants as healing
   agents,  as  well  as  clays  and  soils is ancient. Over time through
   emulation  of  the  behavior  of  fauna  a  medicinal  knowledge  base
   developed   and   passed   between   generations.  As  tribal  culture
   specialized  specific  castes,  shamans and apothecaries fulfilled the
   role of healer.^[citation needed]

   The  first known dentistry dates to about 7,000 B.C.E. in Baluchistan,
   where Neolithic dentists used flint-tipped drills and bowstrings.^[1]

   The  first  known  trepanning  operation  was  carried out about 5,000
   B.C.E. in Ensisheim, France.^[2]

   The  earliest known surgery, an amputation was carried out about 4,900
   B.C.E. in Buthiers-Bulancourt, France.^[3]

Early civilizations[edit]

Egypt[edit]

   Main article: Ancient Egyptian medicine
   The  Edwin  Smith  Surgical  Papyrus,  written in the 17th century BC,
   contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain

   Ancient   Egypt   developed  a  large,  varied  and  fruitful  medical
   tradition. Herodotus described the Egyptians as "the healthiest of all
   men,  next  to  the  Libyans",^[4]  because of the dry climate and the
   notable  public  health  system that they possessed. According to him,
   "the  practice  of  medicine  is  so  specialized among them that each
   physician  is  a healer of one disease and no more." Although Egyptian
   medicine,  to  a  good  extent,  dealt  with  the supernatural,^[5] it
   eventually  developed a practical use in the fields of anatomy, public
   health, and clinical diagnostics.

   Medical  information  in the Edwin Smith Papyrus may date to a time as
   early as 3000 BC.^[6] Imhotep in the 3rd dynasty is sometimes credited
   with being the founder of ancient Egyptian medicine and with being the
   original  author of the Edwin Smith Papyrus, detailing cures, ailments
   and  anatomical observations. The Edwin Smith Papyrus is regarded as a
   copy  of  several  earlier  works and was written c. 1600 BC. It is an
   ancient  textbook  on  surgery  almost  completely  devoid  of magical
   thinking and describes in exquisite detail the examination, diagnosis,
   treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments.^[7]

   The   Kahun  Gynaecological  Papyrus^[8]  treats  women's  complaints,
   including  problems  with  conception.  Thirty  four  cases  detailing
   diagnosis  and^[9] treatment survive, some of them fragmentarily.^[10]
   Dating  to  1800 BCE,  it  is the oldest surviving medical text of any
   kind.

   Medical  institutions, referred to as Houses of Life are known to have
   been   established   in   ancient   Egypt   as   early   as   the  1st
   Dynasty.^[citation needed]

   The  earliest  known  physician  is  also  credited  to ancient Egypt:
   Hesy-Ra,  "Chief  of  Dentists  and Physicians" for King Djoser in the
   27th  century BCE.^[11]  Also,  the  earliest  known  woman physician,
   Peseshet,  practiced  in Ancient Egypt at the time of the 4th dynasty.
   Her  title  was "Lady Overseer of the Lady Physicians." In addition to
   her supervisory role, Peseshet trained midwives at an ancient Egyptian
   medical school in Sais.^[citation needed]

Babylonia[edit]

   Further information: Babylonian medicine

   symbolized by the crooked stick. Wellcome Collection

   The  oldest  Babylonian  texts  on  medicine  date  back  to  the  Old
   Babylonian period in the first half of the
   2nd millennium BCE.^[citation  needed]  The  most extensive Babylonian
   medical  text,  however,  is  the  Diagnostic  Handbook written by the
   ummânu, or chief scholar, Esagil-kin-apli of Borsippa,^[12] during the
   reign of the Babylonian king Adad-apla-iddina (1069–1046 BCE).^[13]

   Along  with  the  Egyptians the Babylonians introduced the practice of
   diagnosis, prognosis, physical examination, and remedies. In addition,
   the   Diagnostic  Handbook  introduced  the  methods  of  therapy  and
   etiology.  The  text  contains  a  list  of medical symptoms and often
   detailed  empirical  observations  along  with  logical  rules used in
   combining  observed  symptoms  on  the  body  of  a  patient  with its
   diagnosis and prognosis.^[14]

   The  Diagnostic  Handbook  was  based  on  a logical set of axioms and
   assumptions,  including  the  modern view that through the examination
   and  inspection  of  the  symptoms  of  a  patient,  it is possible to
   determine the patient's disease, its aetiology and future development,
   and  the  chances of the patient's recovery. The symptoms and diseases
   of  a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as bandages,
   herbs and creams.^[12]

   There  was  little  development after the medieval era. Major European
   treatises  on  medicine took 200 years to reach the Middle East, where
   local   rulers  might  consult  Western  doctors  to  get  the  latest
   treatments.  Medical  works in Arabic, Turkish, and Persian as late as
   1800 were based on medieval Islamic medicine.^[15]

India[edit]

   Main articles: Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha medicine
   Ayurvedic herbal medicines

   The  Atharvaveda, a sacred text of Hinduism dating from the Early Iron
   Age,  is  one of the first Indian text dealing with medicine, like the
   medicine of the Ancient Near East based on concepts of the exorcism of
   demons  and magic. The Atharvaveda also contain prescriptions of herbs
   for  various  ailments. The use of herbs to treat ailments would later
   form a large part of Ayurveda.

   Ayurveda,  meaning  the  "complete knowledge for long life" is another
   medical  system  of  India.  Its  two  most famous texts belong to the
   schools  of Charaka and Sushruta. The earliest foundations of Ayurveda
   were  built  on  a  synthesis of traditional herbal practices together
   with   a  massive  addition  of  theoretical  conceptualizations,  new
   nosologies  and  new  therapies dating from about 600 BCE onwards, and
   coming  out of the communities of thinkers who included the Buddha and
   others.^[16]

   According to the compendium of Charaka, the Charakasamhita, health and
   disease  are  not  predetermined  and  life  may be prolonged by human
   effort.  The  compendium  of  Susruta,  the Susrutasamhita defines the
   purpose  of  medicine  to  cure  the diseases of the sick, protect the
   healthy,  and  to  prolong  life. Both these ancient compendia include
   details  of  the  examination,  diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of
   numerous  ailments.  The  Susrutasamhita  is  notable  for  describing
   procedures  on  various  forms  of surgery, including rhinoplasty, the
   repair  of  torn  ear lobes, perineal lithotomy, cataract surgery, and
   several other excisions and other surgical procedures. Most remarkable
   is  Sushruta's  penchant  for  scientific  classification: His medical
   treatise  consists  of  184  chapters,  1,120  conditions  are listed,
   including injuries and illnesses relating to aging and mental illness.
   The  Sushruta  Samhita  describe 125 surgical instrument, 300 surgical
   procedures and classifies human surgery in 8 categories.^[17]

   The Ayurvedic classics mention eight branches of medicine: kayacikitsa
   (internal   medicine),   salyacikitsa   (surgery  including  anatomy),
   salakyacikitsa  (eye,  ear,  nose, and throat diseases), kaumarabh?tya
   (pediatrics),   bhutavidya   (spirit   medicine),   and  agada  tantra
   (toxicology),  rasayana  (science  of  rejuvenation),  and  vajikara?a
   (Aphrodisiac).  Apart from learning these, the student of Ayurveda was
   expected  to  know ten arts that were indispensable in the preparation
   and  application  of  his  medicines:  distillation, operative skills,
   cooking,   horticulture,   metallurgy,  sugar  manufacture,  pharmacy,
   analysis  and  separation  of  minerals,  compounding  of  metals, and
   preparation  of  alkalis.  The  teaching  of various subjects was done
   during  the  instruction  of  relevant clinical subjects. For example,
   teaching  of anatomy was a part of the teaching of surgery, embryology
   was a part of training in pediatrics and obstetrics, and the knowledge
   of  physiology and pathology was interwoven in the teaching of all the
   clinical  disciplines.  The  normal  length  of the student's training
   appears to have been seven years. But the physician was to continue to
   learn.^[18]

   As  an  alternative form of medicine in India, Unani medicine got deep
   roots  and royal patronage during medieval times. It progressed during
   Indian  sultanate  and mughal periods. Unani medicine is very close to
   Ayurveda. Both are based on theory of the presence of the elements (in
   Unani,  they  are  considered to be fire, water, earth and air) in the
   human  body.  According to followers of Unani medicine, these elements
   are  present in different fluids and their balance leads to health and
   their imbalance leads to illness.^[19]

   By  the  18th  century  A.D., Sanskrit medical wisdom still dominated.
   Muslim rulers built large hospitals in 1595 in Hyderabad, and in Delhi
   in 1719, and numerous commentaries on ancient texts were written.^[20]

China[edit]

   Main article: Traditional Chinese medicine
   Assorted  dried  plant  and  animal  parts used in traditional Chinese
   medicines, clockwise from top left corner: dried Lingzhi (lit. "spirit
   mushrooms"), ginseng, Luo Han Guo, turtle shell underbelly (plastron),
   and dried curled snakes

   China also developed a large body of traditional medicine. Much of the
   philosophy  of  traditional  Chinese  medicine  derived from empirical
   observations  of disease and illness by Taoist physicians and reflects
   the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express
   causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. These
   causative   principles,  whether  material,  essential,  or  mystical,
   correlate as the expression of the natural order of the universe.

   The  foundational text of Chinese medicine is the Huangdi neijing, (or
   Yellow  Emperor's  Inner  Canon),  written  5th century to 3rd century
   BCE.^[21]  Near the end of the 2nd century AD, during the Han dynasty,
   Zhang  Zhongjing,  wrote a Treatise on Cold Damage, which contains the
   earliest  known  reference  to  the  Neijing  Suwen.  The  Jin Dynasty
   practitioner  and  advocate of acupuncture and moxibustion, Huangfu Mi
   (215-282),  also  quotes the Yellow Emperor in his Jiayi jing, c. 265.
   During  the  Tang  Dynasty, the Suwen was expanded and revised, and is
   now  the  best  extant  representation  of  the  foundational roots of
   traditional  Chinese  medicine.  Traditional  Chinese Medicine that is
   based  on  the  use of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage and other
   forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years.

   In   the   18th   century,  during  the  Qing  dynasty,  there  was  a
   proliferation  of popular books as well as more advanced encyclopedias
   on   traditional  medicine.  Jesuit  missionaries  introduced  Western
   science  and  medicine  to  the  royal  court,  the Chinese physicians
   ignored them.^[22]

   Finally  in  the  19th century, Western medicine was introduced at the
   local   level  by  Christian  medical  missionaries  from  the  London
   Missionary  Society  (Britain), the Methodist Church (Britain) and the
   Presbyterian Church (USA). Benjamin Hobson (1816–1873) in 1839, set up
   a  highly  successful Wai Ai Clinic in Guangzhou, China.^[23] The Hong
   Kong College of Medicine for Chinese was founded in 1887 by the London
   Missionary  Society,  with  its  first  graduate  (in  1892) being Sun
   Yat-sen,  who  later  led the Chinese Revolution (1911). The Hong Kong
   College  of  Medicine  for Chinese was the forerunner of the School of
   Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, which started in 1911.

   Because  of the social custom that men and women should not be near to
   one  another,  the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male
   doctors.  The  missionaries sent women doctors such as Dr. Mary Hannah
   Fulton(1854–1927).  Supported  by  the  Foreign  Missions Board of the
   Presbyterian  Church  (USA)  she  in  1902  founded  the first medical
   college  for women in China, the Hackett Medical College for Women, in
   Guangzhou.^[24]

Greece and Roman Empire[edit]

   Main article: Medicine in ancient Greece

   Around  800  BCE  Homer  in  The  Iliad  gives  descriptions  of wound
   treatment  by  the  two  sons  of  Asklepios, the admirable physicians
   Podaleirius  and  Machaon  and  one  acting doctor, Patroclus. Because
   Machaon  is  wounded  and  Podaleirius  is  in  combat  Eurypylus asks
   Patroclus to cut out this arrow from my thigh, wash off the blood with
   warm  water  and spread soothing ointment on the wound.^[25] Askelpios
   like Imhotep becomes god of healing over time.
   View  of  the  Askleipion  of  Kos,  the best preserved instance of an
   Asklepieion.

   Temples  dedicated  to  the  healer-god Asclepius, known as Asclepieia
   (Ancient Greek:    ?s???p?e?a,   sing.   ?s???p?e???,   'Asclepieion),
   functioned  as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.^[26]
   At  these  shrines, patients would enter a dream-like state of induced
   sleep known as enkoimesis (?????µ?s??) not unlike anesthesia, in which
   they  either received guidance from the deity in a dream or were cured
   by   surgery.^[27]  Asclepeia  provided  carefully  controlled  spaces
   conducive  to  healing  and  fulfilled  several of the requirements of
   institutions created for healing.^[26] In the Asclepeion of Epidaurus,
   three  large  marble  boards dated to 350 BCE preserve the names, case
   histories,  complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the
   temple  with  a  problem and shed it there. Some of the surgical cures
   listed,  such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of
   traumatic  foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place,
   but with the patient in a state of enkoimesis induced with the help of
   soporific  substances  such as opium.^[27] Alcmaeon of Croton wrote on
   medicine  between  500 and 450 BCE. He argued that channels linked the
   sensory organs to the brain, and it is possible that he discovered one
   type of channel, the optic nerves, by dissection.^[28]

Hippocrates[edit]

   A  towering  figure  in  the  history  of  medicine  was the physician
   Hippocrates  of  Kos  (c. 460 – c. 370 BCE), considered the "father of
   Western medicine."^[29]^[30] The Hippocratic Corpus is a collection of
   around  seventy  early  medical  works  from  ancient  Greece strongly
   associated   with   Hippocrates   and  his  students.  Most  famously,
   Hippocrates  invented  the  Hippocratic  Oath for physicians, which is
   still relevant and in use today.

   Hippocrates and his followers were first to describe many diseases and
   medical  conditions.  He  is given credit for the first description of
   clubbing  of  the  fingers,  an  important  diagnostic sign in chronic
   suppurative  lung disease, lung cancer and cyanotic heart disease. For
   this reason, clubbed fingers are sometimes referred to as "Hippocratic
   fingers".^[31]  Hippocrates  was  also the first physician to describe
   Hippocratic  face  in  Prognosis. Shakespeare famously alludes to this
   description  when writing of Falstaff's death in Act II, Scene iii. of
   Henry V.^[32]

   Hippocrates  began  to categorize illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic
   and   epidemic,   and  use  terms  such  as,  "exacerbation,  relapse,
   resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence."^[33]^[34]^[35]

   Another  of  Hippocrates's  major  contributions  may  be found in his
   descriptions   of  the  symptomatology,  physical  findings,  surgical
   treatment  and  prognosis of thoracic empyema, i.e. suppuration of the
   lining   of  the  chest  cavity.  His  teachings  remain  relevant  to
   present-day  students  of  pulmonary medicine and surgery. Hippocrates
   was  the  first  documented person to practise cardiothoracic surgery,
   and his findings are still valid.

   Some  of  the techniques and theories developed by Hippocrates are now
   put  into  practice  by  the  fields  of Environmental and Integrative
   Medicine.  These  include  recognizing  the  importance  of  taking  a
   complete  history  which  includes  environmental exposures as well as
   foods  eaten  by  the  patient  which  might play a role in his or her
   illness.

Herophilus and Erasistratus[edit]

   The  Plinthios  Brokhos  as  described  by Greek physician Heraklas, a
   sling  for  binding  a fractured jaw. These writings were preserved in
   one of Oribasius' collections.^[36]

   Two  great  Alexandrians laid the foundations for the scientific study
   of anatomy and physiology, Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of
   Ceos.^[37]  Other  Alexandrian surgeons gave us ligature (hemostasis),
   lithotomy,  hernia  operations,  ophthalmic  surgery, plastic surgery,
   methods  of  reduction of dislocations and fractures, tracheotomy, and
   mandrake  as  an  anaesthetic. Some of what we know of them comes from
   Celsus and Galen of Pergamum.^[38]

   Herophilus  of  Chalcedon, working at the medical school of Alexandria
   placed  intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to
   motion  and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and
   arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not. He and
   his  contemporary, Erasistratus of Chios, researched the role of veins
   and  nerves,  mapping  their  courses  across  the  body. Erasistratus
   connected  the  increased complexity of the surface of the human brain
   compared  to  other animals to its superior intelligence. He sometimes
   employed  experiments  to further his research, at one time repeatedly
   weighing  a  caged  bird,  and  noting its weight loss between feeding
   times. In Erasistratus' physiology, air enters the body, is then drawn
   by  the  lungs  into  the  heart,  where  it is transformed into vital
   spirit,  and  is then pumped by the arteries throughout the body. Some
   of  this  vital spirit reaches the brain, where it is transformed into
   animal spirit, which is then distributed by the nerves.^[39]

Galen[edit]

   The  Greek Galen (129–c. 216 ce) was one of the greatest physicians of
   the  ancient  world, studying and traveling widely in ancient Rome. He
   dissected  animals  to  learn  about  the  body,  and  performed  many
   audacious  operations—including brain and eye surgeries— that were not
   tried  again  for  almost  two  millennia.  In  Ars  medica  ("Arts of
   Medicine"),  he  explained  mental  properties  in  terms  of specific
   mixtures of the bodily parts.^[40]^[41]

   Galen's  medical  works were regarded as authoritative until well into
   the  Middle  Ages.  Galen left a physiological model of the human body
   that  became  the  mainstay  of  the  medieval  physician's university
   anatomy   curriculum,   but   it  suffered  greatly  from  stasis  and
   intellectual  stagnation because some of Galen's ideas were incorrect;
   he did not dissect a human body nor did the medieval lecturers.^[42]

   The  Renaissance  rediscovered  Galen . In 1523 Galen's On the Natural
   Faculties  was published in London. In the 1530s Belgian anatomist and
   physician  Andreas  Vesalius  launched  a project to translate many of
   Galen's Greek texts into Latin. Vesalius's most famous work, De humani
   corporis  fabrica  was  greatly  influenced  by  Galenic  writing  and
   form.^[43]

Roman contributions[edit]

   The Romans invented numerous surgical instruments, including the first
   instruments  unique  to  women,^[44]  as  well as the surgical uses of
   forceps,   scalpels,  cautery,  cross-bladed  scissors,  the  surgical
   needle,  the  sound,  and  speculas.^[45]^[46]  Romans  also performed
   cataract surgery.^[47]

   The  Roman  army  physician  Dioscorides  (c.  40–90  AD), was a Greek
   botanist  and  pharmacologist.  He  wrote  the encyclopedia De Materia
   Medica  describing  over  600  herbal  cures,  forming  an influential
   pharmacopoeia  which  was  used  extensively  for  the following 1,500
   years.^[48]

Islamic World[edit]

   The  Islamic  civilization  rose  to primacy in medical science as its
   physicians   contributed  significantly  to  the  field  of  medicine,
   including  anatomy, ophthalmology, pharmacology, pharmacy, physiology,
   surgery, and the pharmaceutical sciences. The Arabs were influenced by
   ancient  Indian,  Greek,  Roman  and  Byzantine medical practices, and
   developed  these  further.^[49]  Galen  & Hippocrates were pre-eminent
   authorities.  The  translation  of 129 of Galen's works into Arabic by
   the  Nestorian  Christian  Hunayn ibn Ishaq and his assistants, and in
   particular  Galen's  insistence  on  a rational systematic approach to
   medicine,  set the template for Islamic medicine, which rapidly spread
   throughout the Arab Empire.^[50]

Europe[edit]

   Main article: Medieval medicine of Western Europe

   After  A.D.  400,  the  study  and practice of medicine in the Western
   Roman  Empire  went into deep decline. Medical services were provided,
   especially  for  the poor, in the thousands of monastic hospitals that
   sprang  up  across  Europe,  but  the  care was rudimentary and mainly
   palliative.^[51]  Most  of  the writings of Galen and Hippocrates were
   lost  to  the West, with the summaries and compendia of St. Isidore of
   Seville  being  the  primary  channel  for  transmitting Greek medical
   ideas.^[52] The Carolingian renaissance brought increased contact with
   Byzantium  and  a greater awareness of ancient medicine,^[53] but only
   with  the  twelfth century renaissance and the new translations coming
   from  Muslim  and  Jewish  sources in Spain, and the fifteenth century
   flood of resources after the fall of Constantinople did the West fully
   recover its acquaintance with classical antiquity.

   Wallis  identifies  a  prestige  hierarchy  with  university  educated
   physicians   on  top,  followed  by  learned  surgeons;  craft-trained
   surgeons;  barber  surgeons; itinerant specialists such as dentist and
   oculists; empirics; and midwives.^[54]

Schools[edit]

   A miniature depicting the Schola Medica Salernitana

   The first medical schools were opened in the 9th century, most notably
   the  Schola  Medica  Salernitana  at  Salerno  in  southern Italy. The
   cosmopolitan  influences from Greek, Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew sources
   gave  it an international reputation as the Hippocratic City. Students
   from  wealthy families came for three years of preliminary studies and
   five  of medical studies. By the thirteenth century the medical school
   at  Montpellier  began  to  eclipse the Salernitan school. In the 12th
   century  universities  were founded in Italy, France and England which
   soon  developed  schools of medicine. The University of Montpellier in
   France  and Italy's University of Padua and University of Bologna were
   leading  schools.  Nearly  all  the  learning  was  from  lectures and
   readings  in  Hippocrates,  Galen,  Avicenna  and Aristotle. There was
   little clinical work or dissection.

Humours[edit]

   13th century illustration showing the veins.

   The  underlying principle of most medieval medicine was Galen's theory
   of  humours.  This  was  derived  from  the ancient medical works, and
   dominated  all  western  medicine  until  the 19th century. The theory
   stated  that  within  every  individual  there  were  four humours, or
   principal  fluids  - black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood, these
   were  produced  by  various  organs in the body, and they had to be in
   balance  for  a person to remain healthy. Too much phlegm in the body,
   for  example, caused lung problems; and the body tried to cough up the
   phlegm to restore a balance. The balance of humours in humans could be
   achieved  by diet, medicines, and by blood-letting, using leeches. The
   four  humours  were  also  associated  with  the  four  seasons, black
   bile-autumn, yellow bile-summer, phlegm-winter and blood-spring.^[55]

   Healing included both physical and spiritual therapeutics, such as the
   right  herbs,  a suitable diet, clean bedding, and the sense that care
   was  always  at  hand. Other procedures used to help patients included
   the Mass, prayers, relics of saints, and music used to calm a troubled
   mind or quickened pulse.^[56]

Renaissance to Early Modern period 16th-18th century[edit]

   The  Renaissance  brought an intense focus on scholarship to Christian
   Europe.  A  major  effort to translate the Arabic and Greek scientific
   works  into Latin emerged. Europeans gradually became experts not only
   the ancient writings of the Romans and Greeks, but in the contemporary
   writings  of  Islamic  scientists.  During  the later centuries of the
   Renaissance   came   an   increase   in   experimental  investigation,
   particularly  in  the  field  of dissection and body examination, thus
   advancing our knowledge of human anatomy.^[57]
   An experiment from William Harvey's de Motu Cordis, 1628

   The  development  of  modern  neurology began in the 16th century with
   Vesalius,  who described the anatomy of the brain and other organs; he
   had little knowledge of the brain's function, thinking that it resided
   mainly  in  the ventricles. Over his lifetime he corrected over 200 of
   Galen's  mistakes.  Understanding  of  medical  sciences and diagnosis
   improved, but with little direct benefit to health care. Few effective
   drugs   existed,   beyond   opium  and  quinine.  Folklore  cures  and
   potentially  poisonous  metal-based compounds were popular treatments.
   Independently  from  Ibn  al-Nafis,  Michael Servetus rediscovered the
   pulmonary  circulation,  but  this  discovery did not reach the public
   because  it  was written down for the first time in the "Manuscript of
   Paris"^[58] in 1546, and later published in the theological work which
   he  paid  with  his life in 1553. Later this was perfected by Renaldus
   Columbus   and   Andrea  Cesalpino.  Later  William  Harvey  correctly
   described  the  circulatory  system. The most useful tomes in medicine
   used both by students and expert physicians were De Materia Medica and
   Pharmacopoeia.

   Bacteria and protists were first observed with a microscope by Antonie
   van   Leeuwenhoek   in   1676,  initiating  the  scientific  field  of
   microbiology.^[59]

Paracelsus[edit]

   Paracelsus  (1493–1541),  was  an  erratic  and  abusive innovator who
   rejected   Galen  and  bookish  knowledge,  calling  for  experimental
   research,  with  heavy doses of mysticism, alchemy and magic mixed in.
   The  point  is  that  he rejected sacred magic (miracles) under Church
   auspisces and looked for cures in nature.^[60] He preached but he also
   pioneered   the  use  of  chemicals  and  minerals  in  medicine.  His
   hermetical  views  were that sickness and health in the body relied on
   the  harmony  of  man  (microcosm)  and Nature (macrocosm). He took an
   approach  different  from  those before him, using this analogy not in
   the  manner  of  soul-purification  but in the manner that humans must
   have  certain  balances  of minerals in their bodies, and that certain
   illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.^[61]
   Most  of  his  influence  came after his death. Paracelsus is a highly
   controversial  figure  in  the  history of medicine, with most experts
   hailing  him  as a Father of Modern Medicine for shaking off religious
   orthodoxy  and  inspiring many researchers; others say he was a mystic
   more than a scientist and downplay his importance.^[62]^[63]

Padua and Bologna[edit]

   Vesalius's  1543  De  humani  corporis  fabrica  contained intricately
   detailed drawings of human dissections, often in allegorical poses.

   University training of physicians began in the 13th century.

   The  University  of  Padua was founded about 1220 by walkouts from the
   University  of Bologna, and began teaching medicine in 1222. It played
   a  leading  role  in  the identification and treatment of diseases and
   ailments,  specializing  in  autopsies  and  the inner workings of the
   body.^[64]  Starting  in  1595, Padua's famous anatomical theatre drew
   artists   and   scientists  studying  the  human  body  during  public
   dissections.  The  intensive  study of Galen led to critiques of Galen
   modeled  on  his  own  writing,  as in the first book of Vesalius's De
   humani  corporis  fabrica.  Andreas Vesalius held the chair of Surgery
   and   Anatomy  (explicator  chirurgiae)  and  in  1543  published  his
   anatomical discoveries in De Humani Corporis Fabrica. He portrayed the
   human  body  as  an interdependent system of organ groupings. The book
   triggered  great  public interest in dissections and caused many other
   European cities to establish anatomical theatres.^[65]

   At the University of Bologna the training of physicians began in 1219.
   The  Italian  city  attracted  students  from  across  Europe.  Taddeo
   Alderotti  built a tradition of medical education that established the
   characteristic  features of Italian learned medicine and was copied by
   medical  schools  elsewhere. Turisanus (d. 1320) was his student.^[66]
   The  curriculum  was  revised  and  strengthened  in 1560–1590.^[67] A
   representative   professor   was   Julius   Caesar  Aranzi  (Arantius)
   (1530–89).   He  became  Professor  of  Anatomy  and  Surgery  at  the
   University of Bologna in 1556, where he established anatomy as a major
   branch  of medicine for the first time. Aranzi combined anatomy with a
   description  of  pathological  processes,  based  largely  on  his own
   research,  Galen,  and  the  work of his contemporary Italians. Aranzi
   discovered  the  'Nodules  of  Aranzio' in the semilunar valves of the
   heart  and  wrote  the  first  description  of  the  superior  levator
   palpebral  and  the  coracobrachialis  muscles.  His  books (in Latin)
   covered   surgical   techniques   for   many   conditions,   including
   hydrocephalus,  nasal  polyp, goitre and tumours to phimosis, ascites,
   haemorrhoids, anal abscess and fistulae.^[68]

Women[edit]

   Catholic  women  played  large roles in health and healing in medieval
   and  early modern Europe.^[69] A life as a nun was a prestigious role;
   wealthy  families  provided  dowries  for  their  daughters, and these
   funded the convents, while the nuns provided free nursing care for the
   poor.^[70]

   The  Catholic  elites  provided  hospital  services  because  of their
   theology  of  salvation  that good works were the route to heaven. The
   Protestant  reformers  rejected  the  notion  that rich men could gain
   God's   grace  through  good  works—and  thereby  escape  purgatory—by
   providing  cash  endowments  to  charitable  institutions.  They  also
   rejected  the  Catholic  idea  that the poor patients earned grace and
   salvation  through  their suffering.^[71] Protestants generally closed
   all the convents^[72] and most of the hospitals, sending women home to
   become  housewives,  often against their will.^[73] On the other hand,
   local  officials  recognized  the  public value of hospitals, and some
   were  continued  in Protestant lands, but without monks or nuns and in
   the control of local governments.^[74]

   In   London,  the  crown  allowed  two  hospitals  to  continue  their
   charitable  work,  under  nonreligious control of city officials.^[75]
   The  convents were all shut down but Harkness finds that women—some of
   them  former  nuns—were  part of a new system that delivered essential
   medical services to people outside their family. They were employed by
   parishes  and  hospitals, as well as by private families, and provided
   nursing  care  as  well  as some medical, pharmaceutical, and surgical
   services.^[76]

   Meanwhile,  in  Catholic lands such as France, rich families continued
   to fund convents and monasteries, and enrolled their daughters as nuns
   who provided free health services to the poor. Nursing was a religious
   role for the nurse, and there was little call for science.^[77]

Age of Enlightenment[edit]

   During the Age of Enlightenment, the 18th-century, science was held in
   high  esteem  and  physicians upgraded their social status by becoming
   more  scientific.  The  health  field  was  crowded  with self-trained
   barber-surgeons,    apothecaries,   midwives,   drug   peddlers,   and
   charlatans.

   Across  Europe  medical  schools  relied  primarily  on  lectures  and
   readings.  In  the  final  year  student  would  have limited clinical
   experience  by  trailing  the  professor through the wards. Laboratory
   work  was  uncommon, and dissections were rarely done because of legal
   restrictions on cadavers. Most schools were small, and only Edinburgh,
   Scotland,    with   11,000   alumni,   produced   large   numbers   of
   graduates.^[78]^[79]

Britain[edit]

   In  Britain,  there were but three small hospitals after 1550. Pelling
   and Webster estimate that in London in the 1580 to 1600 period, out of
   a  population  of  nearly 200,000 people, there were about 500 medical
   practitioners.  Nurses and midwives are not included. There were about
   50  physicians,  100  licensed  surgeons,  100  apothecaries,  and 250
   additional  unlicensed  practitioners.  In the last category about 25%
   were  women.^[80]  All  across Britain—and indeed all of the world—the
   vast  majority of the people in city, town or countryside depended for
   medical  care on local amateurs with no professional training but with
   a  reputation  as  wise healers who could diagnose problems and advise
   sick  people  what  to  do—and perhaps set broken bones, pull a tooth,
   give some traditional herbs or brews or perform a little magic to cure
   what ailed them.

   The  London Dispensary opened in 1696, the first clinic in the British
   Empire  to  dispense medicines to poor sick people. The innovation was
   slow  to catch on, but new dispensaries were open in the 1770s. In the
   colonies,  small hospitals opened in Philadelphia in 1752, New York in
   1771, and Boston (Massachusetts General Hospital) in 1811.^[81]
   Guy's Hospital in 1820

   Guy's  Hospital,  the  first  great British hospital opened in 1721 in
   London, with funding from businessman Thomas Guy. In 1821 a bequest of
   £200,000  by  William  Hunt in 1829 funded expansion for an additional
   hundred  beds.  Samuel  Sharp  (1709–78), a surgeon at Guy's Hospital,
   from  1733  to 1757, was internationally famous; his A Treatise on the
   Operations  of  Surgery  (1st  ed., 1739), was the first British study
   focused exclusively on operative technique.^[82]

   English  physician  Thomas  Percival (1740–1804) wrote a comprehensive
   system of medical conduct, Medical Ethics, or a Code of Institutes and
   Precepts,  Adapted  to  the  Professional  Conduct  of  Physicians and
   Surgeons (1803) that set the standard for many textbooks.^[83] Mec

Spain and Spanish Empire[edit]

   Depiction of smallpox in Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún's history of
   the  conquest  of  Mexico,  Book XII of the Florentine Codex, from the
   defeated Aztecs' point of view

   In the Spanish empire, the viceregal capital of Mexico City was a site
   of  medical  training  for  physicians  and the creation of hospitals.
   Epidemic  disease  had  decimated indigenous populations starting with
   the early sixteenth-century Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, when
   a black auxiliary in the armed forces of conqueror Hernán Cortés, with
   an  active  case  of  smallpox,  set  off a virgin land epidemic among
   indigenous  peoples,  Spanish  allies and enemies alike. Aztec emperor
   Cuitlahuac  died  of  smallpox.^[84]^[85]  Disease  was  a significant
   factor in the Spanish conquest elsewhere as well.^[86]
   Mexico  City  epidemic  of  1737, with elites calling on the Virgin of
   Guadalupe

   Medical   education   was  instituted  at  the  Royal  and  Pontifical
   University  of  Mexico, and their clientele was urban elites. Male and
   female  curanderos  or  lay practitioners, attended to the ills of the
   popular  classes.  The  Spanish  crown  began  regulating  the medical
   profession  just  a few years after the conquest, setting up the Royal
   Tribunal of the Protomedicato, a board for licensing medical personnel
   in  1527.  It became more systematic after 1646, licensing physicians,
   druggists,  surgeons,  and  bleeders,  and  requiring a license before
   public practice.^[87] Crown regulation of medical practice became more
   general in the Spanish empire.^[88]

   Elites  and the popular classes alike called on divine intervention in
   personal and society-wide health crises, such as the epidemic of 1737.
   The intervention of the Virgin of Guadalupe was depicted in a scene of
   dead  and  dying  Indians,  with elites on their knees praying for her
   aid.  In  the  late  eighteenth  century, the crown began implementing
   secularizing policies on the Iberian peninsula and its overseas empire
   that    sought    to   control   disease   more   systematically   and
   scientifically.^[89]^[90]^[91]

19th century: Rise of modern medicine[edit]

   The  practice  of  medicine  changed  in the face of rapid advances in
   science,  as  well  as  new approaches by physicians. Hospital doctors
   began   much   more  systematic  analysis  of  patients'  symptoms  in
   diagnosis.^[92]   Among   the   more   powerful  new  techniques  were
   anaesthesia,  and  the  development  of  both  antiseptic  and aseptic
   operating  theatres.^[93]  Actual  cures  were  developed  for certain
   endemic  infectious  diseases. However the decline in many of the most
   lethal  diseases  was  more  due  to improvements in public health and
   nutrition than to medicine.

   Medicine was revolutionized in the 19th century and beyond by advances
   in  chemistry  and  laboratory  techniques and equipment, old ideas of
   infectious  disease  epidemiology  were replaced with bacteriology and
   virology.^[59]

Germ theory and bacteriology[edit]

   In  the  1830s  in  Italy,  Agostino Bassi traced the silkworm disease
   muscardine  to  microorganisms. Meanwhile, in Germany, Theodor Schwann
   led  researches  on  alcoholic fermentation by yeast and proposed that
   they  were  alive—that  is,  microorganisms—a claim derided by leading
   chemists,  such  as  Justus von Liebig, seeking solely physicochemical
   explanation,  and  alleging that Schwann's was regressing to vitalism.
   In   1847  in  Vienna,  Ignaz  Semmelweis  (1818–1865),  by  requiring
   physicians   to   clean   their  hands  before  attending  childbirth,
   dramatically  cut  new  mothers' death rate due to childbed fever, yet
   his principles were marginalized and attacked by professional peers.
   Louis Pasteur experimenting on bacteria, c. 1870

   Starting  in  1857  by  confirming Schwann's fermentation experiments,
   Louis  Pasteur  in  France  placed  his  eminent reputation behind the
   belief  that  yeast  are  microorganisms,  and  closed  his  paper  by
   indicating  that  such process might also explain contagious diseases.
   In  1860,  Pasteur's  report  on  bacterial fermention to butyric acid
   motivated  fellow  Frenchman  Casimir  Davaine  to establish a similar
   species,  which  he  called bacteridia, as the pathogen of the disease
   anthrax,  costly  to  the  cattle  industry. Yet bacteridia were found
   inconsistently  and  dismissed  as  a  disease  byproduct,  not cause.
   British   surgeon   Joseph  Lister,  however,  already  took  cue  and
   introduced antisepsis to wound treatment in 1865.

   German  physician  Robert  Koch, noting fellow German Ferdinand Cohn's
   report  of  a  spore  stage of a certain bacterial species, traced the
   life  cycle  of  Davaine's  bacteridia,  identified spores, inoculated
   laboratory  animals  with  them, and reproduced anthrax—a breakthrough
   for experimental pathology and germ theory of disease. Pasteur's group
   added ecological investigations confirming spores' role in the natural
   setting,  while  Koch  published  a  landmark  treatise in 1878 on the
   bacterial pathology of wounds. In 1881, Koch reported discovery of the
   "tubercle bacillus", cementing germ theory and Koch's acclaim.

   Upon  the  outbreak  of  a  cholera epidemic in Alexandria, Egypt, two
   medical missions went to investigate and attend the sick, one was sent
   out  by  Pasteur and the other actually led by Koch.^[94] Koch's group
   returned   victorious   in   1883,   having   discovered  the  cholera
   pathogen.^[94]  In Germany, however, Koch's bacteriologists had to vie
   against  Max von Pettenkofer, Germany's leading proponent of miasmatic
   theory.^[95]  Pettenkofer  conceded bacteria's casual involvement, but
   maintained  that other, environmental factors were required to turn it
   pathogenic,  and  opposed water treatment as a misdirected effort amid
   more important ways to improve public health.^[95] The massive cholera
   epidemic  in  Hamburg in 1892 devastasted Pettenkoffer's position, and
   yielded German public health to "Koch's bacteriology".^[95]

   On  losing  the  1883 rivalry in Alexandria, Pasteur switched research
   direction,  and  introduced his third vaccine—rabies vaccine—the first
   vaccine  for  humans since Jenner's for smallpox.^[94] From across the
   globe, donations poured in, funding the founding of Pasteur Institute,
   the  globe's  first  biomedical  institute, which opened in 1888.^[94]
   Along with Koch's bacteriologists, Pasteur's group—which preferred the
   term  microbiology—led  medicine  into  the  new  era  of  "scientific
   medicine"  upon bacteriology and germ theory.^[94] Accepted from Jakob
   Henle,  Koch's  steps to confirm a species' pathogenicity became famed
   as  "Koch's postulates". Although his proposed tuberculosis treatment,
   tuberculin,  seemingly  failed, it soon was used to test for infection
   with  the  involved species. In 1905, Koch was awarded the Nobel Prize
   in  Physiology  or  Medicine,  and  remains renowned as the founder of
   medical microbiology.^[96]

Women[edit]

Women as nurses[edit]

   Florence  Nightingale  triggered  the  professionalization of nursing.
   Photograph c. 1860

   Women  had  always  served  in  ancillary  roles,  and as midwives and
   healers.  The professionalization of medicine forced them increasingly
   to  the  sidelines.  As  hospitals multiplied they relied in Europe on
   orders  of  Roman  Catholic  nun-nurses,  and  German  Protestant  and
   Anglican  deaconesses  in the early 19th century. They were trained in
   traditional methods of physical care that involved little knowledge of
   medicine.  The  breakthrough to professionalization based on knowledge
   of  advanced  medicine was led by Florence Nightingale in England. She
   resolved  to  provide  more  advanced  training  than  she  saw on the
   Continent.  At  Kaiserswerth,  where  the first German nursing schools
   were  founded  in 1836 by Theodor Fliedner, she said, "The nursing was
   nil  and the hygiene horrible."^[97]) Britain's male doctors preferred
   the  old  system, but Nightingale won out and her Nightingale Training
   School  opened  in  1860  and became a model. The Nightingale solution
   depended  on the patronage of upper class women, and they proved eager
   to  serve.  Royalty  became  involved. In 1902 the wife of the British
   king  took control of the nursing unit of the British army, became its
   president, and renamed it after herself as the Queen Alexandra's Royal
   Army  Nursing  Corps;  when  she died the next queen became president.
   Today  its Colonel In Chief is the daughter-in-law of Queen Elizabeth.
   In  the  United States, upper middle class women who already supported
   hospitals   promoted   nursing.   The  new  profession  proved  highly
   attractive  to women of all backgrounds, and schools of nursing opened
   in  the  late  19th  century. They soon a function of large hospitals,
   where  they  provided  a steady stream of low-paid idealistic workers.
   The  International Red Cross began operations in numerous countries in
   the  late  19th  century, promoting nursing as an ideal profession for
   middle class women.^[98]

   The  Nightingale model was widely copied. Linda Richards (1841 – 1930)
   studied in London and became the first professionally trained American
   nurse.  She established nursing training programs in the United States
   and Japan, and created the first system for keeping individual medical
   records  for  hospitalized  patients.^[99] The Russian Orthodox Church
   sponsored  seven  orders  of nursing sisters in the late 19th century.
   They  ran  hospitals, clinics, almshouses, pharmacies, and shelters as
   well  as  training  schools for nurses. In the Soviet era (1917–1991),
   with  the  aristocratic  sponsors  gone, nursing became a low-prestige
   occupation based in poorly maintained hospitals.^[100]

Women as physicians[edit]

   It  was very difficult for women to become doctors in any field before
   the  1970s.  Elizabeth Blackwell (1821–1910) became the first woman to
   formally  study  and practice medicine in the United States. She was a
   leader  in  women's medical education. While Blackwell viewed medicine
   as a means for social and moral reform, her student Mary Putnam Jacobi
   (1842–1906)   focused   on  curing  disease.  At  a  deeper  level  of
   disagreement,  Blackwell  felt  that  women  would succeed in medicine
   because  of their humane female values, but Jacobi believed that women
   should  participate  as  the  equals of men in all medical specialties
   using  identical  methods,  values  and  insights.^[101] In the Soviet
   Union  although  the majority of medical doctors were women, they were
   paid less than the mostly male factory workers.^[102]

Paris[edit]

   Paris  (France) and Vienna were the two leading medical centers on the
   Continent in the era 1750–1914.

   In the 1770s-1850s Paris became a world center of medical research and
   teaching.  The  "Paris  School"  emphasized that teaching and research
   should    be    based    in   large   hospitals   and   promoted   the
   professionalization  of  the  medical  profession  and the emphasis on
   sanitation  and  public  health.  A  major  reformer  was Jean-Antoine
   Chaptal (1756–1832), a physician who was Minister of Internal Affairs.
   He   created   the   Paris   Hospital,   health  councils,  and  other
   bodies.^[103]

   Louis  Pasteur  (1822–1895)  was one of the most important founders of
   medical   microbiology.   He   is   remembered   for   his  remarkable
   breakthroughs   in   the  causes  and  preventions  of  diseases.  His
   discoveries reduced mortality from puerperal fever, and he created the
   first  vaccines  for rabies and anthrax. His experiments supported the
   germ  theory  of  disease. He was best known to the general public for
   inventing  a method to treat milk and wine in order to prevent it from
   causing  sickness, a process that came to be called pasteurization. He
   is  regarded  as  one  of  the  three  main  founders of microbiology,
   together  with  Ferdinand  Cohn  and Robert Koch. He worked chiefly in
   Paris  and  in  1887 founded the Pasteur Institute there to perpetuate
   his  commitment  to  basic research and its practical applications. As
   soon as his institute was created, Pasteur brought together scientists
   with  various specialties. The first five departments were directed by
   Emile  Duclaux (general microbiology research) and Charles Chamberland
   (microbe  research  applied  to hygiene), as well as a biologist, Ilya
   Ilyich  Mechnikov (morphological microbe research) and two physicians,
   Jacques-Joseph  Grancher  (rabies)  and  Emile Roux (technical microbe
   research).  One  year  after the inauguration of the Institut Pasteur,
   Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world,
   then  entitled Cours de Microbie Technique (Course of microbe research
   techniques).  It  became the model for numeous research centers around
   the world named "Pasteur Institutes."^[104]^[105]

Vienna[edit]

   The  First  Viennese  School  of  Medicine,  1750–1800, was led by the
   Dutchman  Gerard van Swieten (1700–1772), who aimed to put medicine on
   new   scientific   foundations   -   promoting  unprejudiced  clinical
   observation,  botanical  and chemical research, and introducing simple
   but  powerful  remedies.  When  the  Vienna General Hospital opened in
   1784,  it  at  once became the world's largest hospital and physicians
   acquired  a  facility that gradually developed into the most important
   research centre.^[106] Progress ended with the Napoleonic wars and the
   government  shutdown in 1819 of all liberal journals and schools; this
   caused   a   general  return  to  traditionalism  and  eclecticism  in
   medicine.^[107]

   Vienna  was  the  capital  of  a diverse empire and attracted not just
   Germans  but  Czechs,  Hungarians,  Jews,  Poles  and  others  to  its
   world-class  medical facilities. After 1820 the Second Viennese School
   of  Medicine emerged with the contributions of physicians such as Carl
   Freiherr  von Rokitansky, Josef Škoda, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra, and
   Ignaz   Philipp   Semmelweis.   Basic  medical  science  expanded  and
   specialization  advanced.  Furthermore, the first dermatology, eye, as
   well  as  ear,  nose,  and throat clinics in the world were founded in
   Vienna.  The textbook of ophthalmologist Georg Joseph Beer (1763–1821)
   Lehre   von  den  Augenkrankheiten  combined  practical  research  and
   philosophical speculations, and became the standard reference work for
   decades.^[108]

Berlin[edit]

   After  1871  Berlin,  the  capital  of the new German Empire, became a
   leading  center  for  medical  research. Robert Koch (1843–1910) was a
   representative   leader.  He  became  famous  for  isolating  Bacillus
   anthracis (1877), the Tuberculosis bacillus (1882) and Vibrio cholerae
   (1883)  and  for  his development of Koch's postulates. He was awarded
   the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905 for his tuberculosis
   findings.  Koch is one of the founders of microbiology, inspiring such
   major figures as Paul Ehrlich and Gerhard Domagk.^[105]

U.S. Civil War[edit]

   American Civil War hospital at Gettysburg, 1863

   In  the  American  Civil  War  (1861–65),  as  was typical of the 19th
   century, more soldiers died of disease than in battle, and even larger
   numbers   were   temporarily  incapacitated  by  wounds,  disease  and
   accidents.^[109]  Conditions  were  poor  in  the  Confederacy,  where
   doctors and medical supplies were in short supply.^[110] The war had a
   dramatic  long-term  impact  on  medicine  in  the U.S., from surgical
   technique to hospitals to nursing and to research facilities.

   The  hygiene  of  the training and field camps was poor, especially at
   the  beginning  of  the war when men who had seldom been far from home
   were  brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First
   came  epidemics  of  the  childhood  diseases  of  chicken pox, mumps,
   whooping  cough,  and,  especially,  measles.  Operations in the South
   meant  a  dangerous  and  new  disease environment, bringing diarrhea,
   dysentery,  typhoid  fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so
   the  surgeons  prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather,
   bad  water,  inadequate  shelter  in winter quarters, poor policing of
   camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.^[111]

   This  was  a  common  scenario  in  wars  from  time  immemorial,  and
   conditions  faced  by  the Confederate army were even worse. The Union
   responded  by  building  army  hospitals  in  every  state.  What  was
   different  in  the  Union  was  the  emergence of skilled, well-funded
   medical  organizers  who took proactive action, especially in the much
   enlarged  United  States Army Medical Department,^[112] and the United
   States Sanitary Commission, a new private agency.^[113] Numerous other
   new  agencies  also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers,
   including  the  United  States Christian Commission as well as smaller
   private agencies.^[114]

   The  U.S. Army learned many lessons and in August 1886, it established
   the Hospital Corps.

Statistical methods[edit]

   "Diagram  of  the  causes  of  mortality  in  the army in the East" by
   Florence Nightingale.

   A  major  breakthrough  in  epidemiology came with the introduction of
   statistical   maps  and  graphs.  They  allowed  careful  analysis  of
   seasonality  issues  in disease incidents, and the maps allowed public
   health officials to identifical critical loci for the dissemination of
   disease.  John  Snow  in  London  developed the methods. English nurse
   Florence   Nightingale   pioneered   analysis   of  large  amounts  of
   statistical  data, using graphs and tables, regarding the condition of
   thousands  of  patients in the Crimean War to evaluate the efficacy of
   hospital services. Her methods proved convincing and led to reforms in
   military  and civilian hospitals, usually with the full support of the
   government.^[115]

   By  the  late 19th and early 20th century English statisticians led by
   Francis   Galton,   Karl  Pearson  and  Ronald  Fisher  developed  the
   mathematical tools such as correlations and hypothesis tests that made
   possible much more sophisticated analysis of statistical data.^[116]

   During  the  U.S. Civil War the Sanitary Commission collected enormous
   amounts  of  statistical  data,  and opened up the problems of storing
   information  for  fast  access  and  mechanically  searching  for data
   patterns.  The  pioneer  was  John Shaw Billings (1838–1913). A senior
   surgeon  in  the  war,  Billings  built  the  Library  of  the Surgeon
   General's   Office   (now   the  National  Library  of  Medicine,  the
   centerpiece  of  modern  medical  information  systems.^[117] Billings
   figured  out  how to mechanically analyze medical and demographic data
   by  turning facts into numbers and punching the numbers onto cardboard
   cards  that  could  be sorted and counted by machine. The applications
   were  developed  by his assistant Herman Hollerith; Hollerith invented
   the  punch  card  and counter-sorter system that dominated statistical
   data   manipulation   until  the  1970s.  Hollerith's  company  became
   International Business Machines (IBM) in 1911.^[118]

Worldwide dissemination[edit]

United States[edit]

   Johns  Hopkins  Hospital,  founded  in 1889, originated several modern
   medical practices, including residency and rounds.

Japan[edit]

   European ideas of modern medicine were spread widely through the world
   by  medical missionaries, and the dissemination of textbooks. Japanese
   elites  enthusiastically  embraced  Western  medicine  after the Meiji
   Restoration  of  the  1860s.  However  they had been prepared by their
   knowledge  of the Dutch and German medicine, for they had some contact
   with Europe through the Dutch. Highly influential was the 1765 edition
   of  Hendrik  van Deventer's pioneer work Nieuw Ligt ("A New Light") on
   Japanese  obstetrics,  especially on Katakura Kakuryo's publication in
   1799  of  Sanka Hatsumo ("Enlightenment of Obstetrics").^[119]^[120] A
   cadre of Japanese physicians began to interact with Dutch doctors, who
   introduced  smallpox  vaccinations.  By  1820  Japanese  ranpô medical
   practitioners not only translated Dutch medical texts, they integrated
   their  readings  with  clinical diagnoses. These men became leaders of
   the  modernization  of  medicine  in  their  country.  They broke from
   Japanese  traditions  of  closed  medical fraternities and adopted the
   European  approach  of  an  open  community  of collaboration based on
   expertise in the latest scientific methods.^[121]

   Kitasato Shibasaburo (1853–1931) studied bacteriology in Germany under
   Robert  Koch.  In 1891 he founded the Institute of Infectious Diseases
   in  Tokyo, which introduced the study of bacteriology to Japan. He and
   French  researcher  Alexandre Yersin went to Hong Kong in 1894, where;
   Kitasato  confirmed  Yersin's  discovery  that  the bacterium Yersinia
   pestis  is  the agent of the plague. In 1897 he isolates and described
   the  organism  that  caused  dysentery.  He  became  the first dean of
   medicine  at  Keio  University,  and  the first president of the Japan
   Medical Association.^[122]^[123]

   Japanese  physicians immediately recognized the values of X-Rays. They
   were able to purchase the equipment locally from the Shimadzu Company,
   which   developed,   manufactured,  marketed,  and  distributed  X-Ray
   machines  after  1900.^[124]  Japan not only adopted German methods of
   public  health  in  the  home  islands,  but  implemented  them in its
   colonies,   especially   Korea   and   Taiwan,   and   after  1931  in
   Manchuria.^[125]  A  heavy  investment  in  sanitation  resulted  in a
   dramatic increase of life expectancy.^[126]

Psychiatry[edit]

   Further information: History of psychiatry
   The  Quaker-run  York  Retreat,  founded in 1796, gained international
   prominence  as  a  centre  for  moral  treatment and a model of asylum
   reform  following  the publication of Samuel Tuke's Description of the
   Retreat (1813).

   Until  the  nineteenth  century,  the care of the insane was largely a
   communal and family responsibility rather than a medical one. The vast
   majority  of  the  mentally ill were treated in domestic contexts with
   only  the most unmanageable or burdensome likely to be institutionally
   confined.^[127] This situation was transformed radically from the late
   eighteenth  century as, amid changing cultural conceptions of madness,
   a  new-found  optimism in the curability of insanity within the asylum
   setting  emerged.^[128]  Increasingly,  lunacy was perceived less as a
   physiological  condition than as a mental and moral one^[129] to which
   the  correct  response  was  persuasion, aimed at inculcating internal
   restraint,  rather  than external coercion.^[130] This new therapeutic
   sensibility,  referred to as moral treatment, was epitomised in French
   physician   Philippe  Pinel's  quasi-mythological  unchaining  of  the
   lunatics  of  the  Bicêtre  Hospital in Paris^[131] and realised in an
   institutional  setting  with  the foundation in 1796 of the Quaker-run
   York Retreat in England.^[9]
   Patient,   Surrey  County  Lunatic  Asylum,  c.  1850–58.  The  asylum
   population  in  England and Wales rose from 1,027 in 1827 to 74,004 in
   1900.

   From  the early nineteenth century, as lay-led lunacy reform movements
   gained  in  influence,^[132]  ever  more state governments in the West
   extended   their   authority  and  responsibility  over  the  mentally
   ill.^[133]  Small-scale  asylums,  conceived as instruments to reshape
   both  the  mind  and  behaviour  of  the disturbed,^[134] proliferated
   across  these  regions.^[135]  By the 1830s, moral treatment, together
   with  the  asylum  itself,  became  increasingly medicalised^[136] and
   asylum doctors began to establish a distinct medical identity with the
   establishment  in  the  1840s  of  associations  for  their members in
   France,  Germany,  the  United  Kingdom and America, together with the
   founding of medico-psychological journals.^[9] Medical optimism in the
   capacity  of  the  asylum  to cure insanity soured by the close of the
   nineteenth  century  as  the  growth  of  the  asylum  population  far
   outstripped  that  of  the  general population.^[a]^[137] Processes of
   long-term  institutional  segregation,  allowing  for  the psychiatric
   conceptualisation  of  the natural course of mental illness, supported
   the perspective that the insane were a distinct population, subject to
   mental  pathologies  stemming  from  specific medical causes.^[134] As
   degeneration   theory   grew  in  influence  from  the  mid-nineteenth
   century,^[138]  heredity  was  seen  as  the central causal element in
   chronic  mental  illness,^[139]  and,  with  national  asylum  systems
   overcrowded and insanity apparently undergoing an inexorable rise, the
   focus of psychiatric therapeutics shifted from a concern with treating
   the  individual  to  maintaining  the  racial and biological health of
   national populations.^[140]

   Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) introduced new medical categories of mental
   illness,  which  eventually  came into psychiatric usage despite their
   basis in behavior rather than pathology or etiology. Shell shock among
   frontline  soldiers  exposed  to heavy artillery bombardment was first
   diagnosed  by  British Army doctors in 1915. By 1916, similar symptoms
   were  also  noted in soldiers not exposed to explosive shocks, leading
   to   questions   as   to   whether   the   disorder  was  physical  or
   psychiatric.^[141]  In  the  1920s surrealist opposition to psychiatry
   was  expressed  in  a  number of surrealist publications. In the 1930s
   several  controversial  medical  practices  were  introduced including
   inducing seizures (by electroshock, insulin or other drugs) or cutting
   parts  of  the  brain  apart  (leucotomy  or lobotomy). Both came into
   widespread  use  by psychiatry, but there were grave concerns and much
   opposition   on   grounds  of  basic  morality,  harmful  effects,  or
   misuse.^[142]

   In   the  1950s  new  psychiatric  drugs,  notably  the  antipsychotic
   chlorpromazine,  were  designed  in  laboratories and slowly came into
   preferred  use.  Although  often  accepted as an advance in some ways,
   there  was  some  opposition,  due  to serious adverse effects such as
   tardive  dyskinesia.  Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or
   stopped  taking  the  drugs  when  not subject to psychiatric control.
   There  was  also  increasing  opposition  to  the  use  of psychiatric
   hospitals,  and  attempts  to move people back into the community on a
   collaborative  user-led group approach ("therapeutic communities") not
   controlled  by psychiatry. Campaigns against masturbation were done in
   the  Victorian era and elsewhere. Lobotomy was used until the 1970s to
   treat  schizophrenia.  This  was  denounced  by  the  anti-psychiatric
   movement in the 1960s and later.donu

20th century and beyond[edit]

Twentieth Century Warfare and Medicine[edit]

   The  ABO  blood  group  system  was discovered in 1901, and the Rhesus
   group in 1937, facilitating blood transfusion.

   During  the  20th  century, large-scale wars were attended with medics
   and  mobile  hospital  units  which  developed advanced techniques for
   healing   massive  injuries  and  controlling  infections  rampant  in
   battlefield  conditions.  During  the  Mexican Revolution (1910-1920),
   General  Pancho  Villa organized hospital trains for wounded soldiers.
   Boxcars   marked   Servicio   Sanitario   ("sanitary   service")  were
   re-purposed as surgical operating theaters and areas for recuperation,
   and  staffed by up to 40 Mexican and U.S. physicians. Severely wounded
   soldiers   were   shuttled  back  to  base  hospitals.^[143]  Canadian
   physician  Norman  Bethune,  M.D. developed a mobile blood-transfusion
   service for frontline operations in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939),
   but ironically, he himself died of blood poisoning.^[144] Thousands of
   scarred  troops  provided  the  need for improved prosthetic limbs and
   expanded  techniques  in  plastic  surgery  or reconstructive surgery.
   Those  practices  were  combined to broaden cosmetic surgery and other
   forms of elective surgery.

   During  the  First  World War, Alexis Carrel and Henry Dakin developed
   the Carrel-Dakin method of treating wounds with an irrigation, Dakin's
   solution, a germicide which helped prevent gangrene.^[145]

   The  Great  War  spurred  the  usage  of  Roentgen's  X-ray,  and  the
   electrocardiograph,  for  the monitoring of internal bodily functions.
   This  was  followed  in the inter-war period by the development of the
   first anti-bacterial agents such as the sulpha antibiotics.

Public health[edit]

   Main article: Public health

   Public health measures became particular important during the 1918 flu
   pandemic,   which  killed  at  least  50  million  people  around  the
   world.^[146]  It became an important case study in epidemiology.^[147]
   Bristow  shows  there  was a gendered response of health caregivers to
   the  pandemic  in  the United States. Male doctors were unable to cure
   the patients, and they felt like failures. Women nurses also saw their
   patients die, but they took pride in their success in fulfilling their
   professional  role  of caring for, ministering, comforting, and easing
   the  last  hours  of  their  patients, and helping the families of the
   patients cope as well.^[148]

   From  1917  to  1923,  the American Red Cross moved into Europe with a
   battery  of  long-term  child  health  projects. It built and operated
   hospitals  and  clinics, and organized antituberculosis and antityphus
   campaigns.  A  high  priority  involved  child health programs such as
   clinics,  better baby shows, playgrounds, fresh air camps, and courses
   for  women  on  infant  hygiene. Hundreds of U.S. doctors, nurses, and
   welfare  professionals  administered  these  programs,  which aimed to
   reform  the  health  of  European youth and to reshape European public
   health and welfare along American lines.^[149]

Second World War[edit]

   American  combat  surgery  during  the  Pacific  War, 1943. Major wars
   showed the need for effective hygiene and medical treatment.

   The advances in medicine made a dramatic difference for Allied troops,
   while  the  Germans  and  especially the Japanese and Chinese suffered
   from  a  severe  lack  of  newer medicines, techniques and facilities.
   Harrison  finds  that  the  chances  of  recovery  for a badly wounded
   British  infantryman were as much as 25 times better than in the First
   World War. The reason was that:

          "By  1944 most casualties were receiving treatment within hours
          of  wounding,  due to the increased mobility of field hospitals
          and  the extensive use of aeroplanes as ambulances. The care of
          the  sick  and  wounded  had  also  been  revolutionized by new
          medical  technologies,  such  as  active  immunization  against
          tetanus, sulphonamide drugs, and penicillin."^[150]

Nazi and Japanese medicine[edit]

   Unethical  human  subject  research,  and  killing  of  patients  with
   disabilities,   peaked   during   the   Nazi   era,  with  Nazi  human
   experimentation  and  Aktion  T4  during  the  Holocaust  as  the most
   significant  examples. Many of the details of these and related events
   were  the  focus  of  the  Doctors' Trial. Subsequently, principles of
   medical ethics, such as the Nuremberg Code, were introduced to prevent
   a  recurrence  of such atrocities.^[151] After 1937, the Japanese Army
   established  programs  of  biological  warfare  in China. In Unit 731,
   Japanese  doctors  and  research scientists conducted large numbers of
   vivisections   and   experiments   on  human  beings,  mostly  Chinese
   victims.^[152]

Malaria[edit]

   Main article: History of malaria

   Starting in World War II, DDT was used as insecticide to combat insect
   vectors  carrying  malaria, which was endemic in most tropical regions
   of the world.^[153] The first goal was to protect soldiers, but it was
   widely adopted as a public health device. In Liberia, for example, the
   United  States  had  large  military operations during the war and the
   U.S.  Public  Health  Service began the use of DDT for indoor residual
   spraying  (IRS)  and  as  a  larvicide,  with  the goal of controlling
   malaria  in  Monrovia,  the  Liberian capital. In the early 1950s, the
   project  was  expanded  to  nearby villages. In 1953, the World Health
   Organization (WHO) launched an antimalaria program in parts of Liberia
   as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication
   in  tropical  Africa.  However  these  projects encountered a spate of
   difficulties  that  foreshadowed  the  general  retreat  from  malaria
   eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s.^[154]

Post-World War II[edit]

   Smallpox  vaccination  in  Niger,  1969.  A decade later, this was the
   first infectious disease to be eradicated.
   Most  countries  have  seen  a  tremendous increase in life expectancy
   since  1945.  However,  in southern Africa, the HIV epidemic beginning
   around 1990 has eroded national health.
   A  cochlear  implant  is  a common kind of neural prosthesis, a device
   replacing part of the human nervous system.

   The  World Health Organization was founded in 1948 as a United Nations
   agency to improve global health. In most of the world, life expectancy
   has  improved  since then, and was about 67 years as of 2010, and well
   above  80  years in some countries. Eradication of infectious diseases
   is  an  international  effort,  and  several  new  vaccines  have been
   developed  during  the  post-war  years,  against  infections  such as
   measles,  mumps,  several  strains  of  influenza  and human papilloma
   virus.  The long-known vaccine against Smallpox finally eradicated the
   disease   in  the  1970s,  and  Rinderpest  was  wiped  out  in  2011.
   Eradication  of  polio  is  underway.  Tissue culture is important for
   development  of  vaccines.  Though  the  early  success  of  antiviral
   vaccines  and antibacterial drugs, antiviral drugs were not introduced
   until  the  1970s.  Through  the  WHO, the international community has
   developed  a response protocol against epidemics, displayed during the
   SARS  epidemic  in 2003, the Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 from 2004,
   the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa and onwards.

   As  infectious  diseases  have become less lethal, and the most common
   causes   of   death   in   developed  countries  are  now  tumors  and
   cardiovascular  diseases,  these  conditions  have  received increased
   attention  in  medical  research.  Tobacco  smoking as a cause of lung
   cancer was first researched in the 1920s, but was not widely supported
   by  publications  until the 1950s. Cancer treatment has been developed
   with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgical oncology.

   Oral  rehydration therapy has been extensively used since the 1970s to
   treat cholera and other diarrhea-inducing infections.

   The  sexual  revolution  included  taboo-breaking  research  in  human
   sexuality  such  as  the  1948  and  1953 Kinsey reports, invention of
   hormonal   contraception,   ant  the  normalization  of  abortion  and
   homosexuality  in  many  countries.  Family  planning  has  promoted a
   demographic transition in most of the world. With threatening sexually
   transmitted  infections,  not  least HIV, use of barrier contraception
   has   become   imperative.  The  struggle  against  HIV  has  improved
   antiretroviral  treatments,  and  in  the  late  2000s  (decade), male
   circumcision  was  cited  to diminish infection risk (see circumcision
   and HIV).

   X-ray  imaging  was  the  first  kind  of  medical  imaging, and later
   ultrasonic imaging, CT scanning, MR scanning and other imaging methods
   became available.

   Genetics have advanced with the discovery of the DNA molecule, genetic
   mapping  and  gene  therapy.  Stem cell research took off in the 2000s
   (decade), with stem cell therapy as a promising method.

   Evidence-based  medicine  is  a  modern  concept,  not  introduced  to
   literature until the 1990s.

   Prosthetics  have improved. In 1958, Arne Larsson in Sweden became the
   first patient to depend on an artificial cardiac pacemaker. He died in
   2001  at  age  86,  having  outlived its inventor, the surgeon, and 26
   pacemakers.  Lightweight  materials  as  well  as  neural  prosthetics
   emerged in the end of the 20th century.

Modern surgery[edit]

   Cardiac  surgery  was revolutionized in the 1948 as open-heart surgery
   was introduced for the first time since 1925.

   In  1954  Joseph  Murray, J. Hartwell Harrison and others accomplished
   the  first  kidney  transplantation. Transplantations of other organs,
   such  as  heart,  liver  and pancreas, were also introduced during the
   latter  20th  century. The first partial face transplant was performed
   in  2005,  and  the  first  full  one  in 2010. By the end of the 20th
   century,  microtechnology had been used to create tiny robotic devices
   to  assist  microsurgery  using micro-video and fiber-optic cameras to
   view   internal   tissues   during  surgery  with  minimally  invasive
   practices.^[155]

   Laparoscopic  surgery  was  broadly  introduced  in the 1990s. Natural
   orifice  surgery  has  followed.  Remote  surgery  is  another  recent
   development,  with the Lindbergh operation in 2001 as a groundbreaking
   example.

Explanatory notes[edit]

    1. Jump up ^ England and Wales had nine county and borough asylums in
       1827  with  an average capacity of a little over 100 patients, but
       by  1890  there  were  66  such  asylums containing on average 800
       patients  each;^[157]  the  total  number  of patients so confined
       increased  from  1,027 in 1827 to 74,004 in 1900.^[158] Similarly,
       in  Germany, between 1852 and 1898 the asylum population increased
       seven-fold from 11,622 to 74,087 patients during a period when the
       total  population had only grown by ten per cent.^[133] In America
       the  asylum  population  had risen to almost 250,000 on the eve of
       the First World War.^[159]
